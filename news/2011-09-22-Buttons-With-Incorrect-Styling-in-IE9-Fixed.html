	2011-09-22 - Buttons With Incorrect Styling in IE9 Fixed

</h1>

<div class="main">
<div class="contents0">
	<p>An issue that was causing button widgets to not have the correct mouse cursor when mousing over them in IE9 has been fixed.</p>
	
	<p>Testing of the examples of the UIZE Web site in IE9 revealed an issue with the mouse cursor for button widgets. This issue was caused by a specific change in behavior in IE9, which now only supports the standard <code>pointer</code> value for the <code>cursor</code> style property, and no longer supports the defunct <code>hand</code> value for this property that was required for older versions of IE.</p>
	
	<p>This problem was surfacing with button widgets because the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Widget.Button.html">Uize.Widget.Button</a></code> class relies on the <code>Uize.Node.showClickable</code> static method of the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Node.html">Uize.Node</a></code> module. The <code>Uize.Node.showClickable</code> method, in turn, was always conditionalized to use the <code>hand</code> value for Internet Explorer browsers. In order to fix the issue, the IE conditionalization is now limited to major versions earlier than IE9. As part of this fix, the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Node.html">Uize.Node</a></code> module also now provides the <code>Uize.Node.ieMajorVersion</code> static property.</p>
	
	<p>With this change, button widgets in the UIZE Web site's examples should now correctly show the "hand" cursor when mousing over them in IE9, to indicate that they are clickable (unless they are disabled, of course).</p>
