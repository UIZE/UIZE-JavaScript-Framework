	<p>The event system of the UIZE JavaScript Framework has been improved with <a href="#1">More Concisely Named Methods</a> and the addition of a <a href="#2">Dedicated Event Relay Facility</a>.</p>

		<div class="contents2">
			<p>A number of instance methods of the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.html">Uize</a></code> class have been deprecated.</p>
			
			
<pre class="sample-code">myInstance.addEventHandler      &gt;&gt; BECOMES &gt;&gt;  myInstance.wire
myInstance.addEventHandlers     &gt;&gt; BECOMES &gt;&gt;  myInstance.wire
myInstance.fireEvent            &gt;&gt; BECOMES &gt;&gt;  myInstance.fire
myInstance.removeEventHandler   &gt;&gt; BECOMES &gt;&gt;  myInstance.unwire
myInstance.removeEventHandlers  &gt;&gt; BECOMES &gt;&gt;  myInstance.unwire
</pre>
			
			<p>The single and multiple handler instance methods have been combined. So, both <code>addEventHandler</code> and <code>addEventHandlers</code> are replaced with just <code>wire</code>, which provides variations for both single handler and multiple handler usage. The same applies to the <code>removeEventHandler</code> and <code>removeEventHandlers</code> methods, which have both been replaced with just <code>unwire</code>. With this change, there are now three event management instance methods: <code>fire</code>, <code>wire</code>, and <code>unwire</code>.</p>

		<div class="contents2">
			<p>For backwards compatibility, the deprecated event management methods are still supported, and will be supported for some time into the future.</p>
			
			<p>All existing code using the deprecated methods should continue to work as normal. It would be wise to progressively migrate code over to using the new methods.</p>

	<div class="contents1">
		<p>A dedicated facility has been added for relaying events from one class or instance to another.</p>
		
		<p>To relay an event to a <code><a href="../reference/Uize.html">Uize</a></code> subclass or an instance of a <code><a href="../reference/Uize.html">Uize</a></code> subclass, simple specify a reference to the class or instance as the handler for the event you wish to relay, as shown in the example below.</p>
