	<div class="contents1">
		<p>All modules of the UIZE JavaScript Framework are now designed to be safe to load in a non-browser context, such as Microsoft's Windows Script Host.</p>
		
		<p>There were some modules that would fail to load because certain aspects of the initialization of the modules relied on specific features exposed by a Web browser, such as the <code>window</code>, <code>document</code>, and <code>navigator</code> objects. These modules have been updated to deal gracefully with the non-existence of those objects in non-browser contexts. This allows an automated unit test system to at least verify that these modules can be loaded and that their code does not contain fatal syntax errors or other crippling errors of initialization / module setup - without having to involve a Web browser. Features of the modules may still not be usable in a non-browser context, but at least the modules can be sanity checked for basic well-formedness of the JavaScript. This is particularly helpful for the automatic testing of the loadability of the scrunched versions of modules.</p>
