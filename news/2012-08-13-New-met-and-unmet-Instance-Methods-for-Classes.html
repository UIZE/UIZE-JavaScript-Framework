			<p>The <code>met</code> method is offered as a convenience to improve the semantics of code that is using state properties to represent conditions, and is a very thin wrapper around the <code>set</code> instance method.</p>
			
			<p>The statement <code>myInstance.met ('myCondition')</code> is equivalent to the statement <code>myInstance.set ('myCondition',true)</code>. When using a state property to represent a condition, the <code>met</code> method is a semantically elegant way to set the value of the property to <code>true</code> to indicate that the condition represented by the property has been met.</p>
			
			<p><span class="allCaps">EXAMPLE</span></p>
			
			
<pre class="sample-code">MyClass.prototype.initialize = function () {
  // some code here to do the initialization
  this.met ('initialized');
};
</pre>
			
			<p>In the above example, an <code>initialize</code> instance method is defined for the class <code>MyClass</code>. In the method's implementation, after all the initialization has been performed, the <code>met</code> method is being called to indicate that the <code>initialized</code> condition has been met, where <code>initialized</code> is the name of a state property provided in <code>MyClass</code>. Now, other code can be registered to be executed only once an instance has been initialized by using the <code>once</code> instance method, as follows...</p>
			
			
<pre class="sample-code">myInstance.once (
  'initialized',
  function () {
    // do some stuff once the instance has been initialized
