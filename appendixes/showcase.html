	<p>In the software industry, the phrase "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_one%27s_own_dog_food" class="externalSiteLink" target="_blank">eating one's own dog food</a>" refers to the practice of using one's own software, in just the same way as any other end user or developer who is expected to be using your software. This practice forces developers of software to deal with real problems and use cases that may arise with the software they develop.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>In the spirit of eating one's own dog food, the <b>uize.com</b> Web site makes extensive use of the UIZE JavaScript Framework, and can be regarded as a model for how to effectively develop a Web site with modular, well factored, object oriented, rich client interaction logic. The many <a href="../javascript-examples.html">JavaScript examples</a> in the Web site are an overt demonstration of and showcase for the many features of the framework, but the Web site itself is also a great showcase.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>From build and deploy scripts that are used to update the Web site, to the rich interactivity on the many pages of the Web site, <b>uize.com</b> pushes the boundaries of the framework's capabilities.</p>
