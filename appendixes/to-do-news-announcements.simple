This document lists official news announcements that need to be created for developments that have already taken place.

### Bugs to fix
	- examples with fruits images broken because of Zazzle changes
		- Slideshow of Data
		- Scrolly Carousel

Improved Uize.recordMatches, Uize.findRecord, and Uize.findRecordNo Methods
	- match parameter can now be a value matcher function

	Behavior Change in the =Uize.findRecordNo= Method
		Now, if a matching record cannot be found in the specified records array, then the optionally specified default value will be coerced to a number and constrained to the range of =-1= to the length of the records array minus one (ie. the index of the last record in the array).

		Therefore, it will not be possible to have the =Uize.findRecordNo= return a value that is not the valid index for a record in the records array, unless the value is =-1= as a valid way to indicate no match.
