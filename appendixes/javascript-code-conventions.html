			<div class="contents3">
				<p>Being a language that is used most often (yet not always) in the context of a Web browser, and being that JavaScript is often used to construct HTML snippets for output into a document, it is a sensible convention to always use single quotes for string literals in JavaScript code. This allows HTML tag attributes, in HTML that is being constructed by the JavaScript, to use double quotes - without having to worry about escaping them.</p>
				
				<p><span class="allCaps">EXAMPLE</span></p>
				
				
<pre class="sample-code">function getImgTagHtml (url,width,height) {
  return '&lt;img src="' + url + '" width="' + width + '" height="' + height + '"/&gt;';

Always Use Single Quotes For String Literals -&gt; 2.1.2. Consistency For Sanity">2</a>. </span>Consistency For Sanity</h3>
			<div class="contents3">
				<p>Sticking to using the same quotes for all string literals makes it easier to refactor code, since one can do a simple text search rather than having to do a regular expression search (which is slower and requires more thought). The worst side effect of using inconsistent quotes for string literals is that a person refactoring code might assume that only one kind of quoting is used (or may be lazy), and then only finds and changes the string literals quoted in one way but misses identical strings quoted the other way, thereby breeding bugs in the code.</p>
				
				<p>Now, there will come times when string literals will want to contain single quotes in their contents. To adhere to the consistency rule, these string literals should still be single quoted and the single quotes inside their contents should be escaped. Fortunately, this case doesn not arise often enough for the consistency rule to be terribly cumbersome. The alternative is to become lax about it, thereby forcing anyone doing refactoring to use regular expressions to be safe. As soon as you start having to use regular expressions for such searches, you're going to have to start escaping characters that are regular expression operators, like "(", ")", "+", "*", "?", "[", "]", "\", "^", "$", "|", ".". And what a royal pain that is!</p>

For example, it's pretty clear from an identifier name like <code>propertyName</code> that it is a string, or from <code>elementNo</code> that it is an integer.</p>
			
			<p>Hungarian notation (where a type prefix is prepended to identifier names) is generally discouraged. When it is desirable to explicitly denote type in an identifier name, code in the UIZE JavaScript Framework follows the convention of appending a type indicator such as <code>Str</code> (as in <code>userInfoStr</code>) or <code>Obj</code> (as in <code>userProfileObj</code>).</p>

				<p>Equivalent naming also makes your code more "portable", since code that is moved during refactoring is then more likely to be consistent / compatible in its variable naming with any new context into which it is placed. For example, whenever possible, name a local variable that will be passed as a parameter to a function the same as the name for the parameter in the function.</p>
				
				
<pre class="sample-code">function myFunction1 () {
  var _date;

}

function myFunction2 (_date) {

}
</pre>
				
				<p>This makes it easier to opt later to transplant code from a function to inline where the function was previously being called. As code changes, the number of times some set of logic is used can change. Following this convention eases the removal of a block of code into a separate function, or the replacement of the separate function's code back into a place where it was being called.</p>

		<div class="contents2">
			<p>Strive to make code self-explanatory. Ideally, the code is its own documentation. The UIZE JavaScript Framework makes extensive use of long identifier names. Private identifier names will get scrunched and become very short for the production environment, so don't worry about the impact of verbose naming on code size.</p>
			
			<p>Avoid short and generic iterator names in favor of descriptive iterator names that serve to reinforce the action of the code on reading. So, for example, instead of just using <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>, use <code>rowNo</code> and <code>columnNo</code>.</p>
			
			<p>Avoid arbitrary and/or obtuse abbreviation of words. So, for example, don't use <code>bkgdClr</code> when you could just use <code>backgroundColor</code>. Identifiers that are explicit and use full words emphasize their meaning in the context of the code.</p>

Naming Conventions -&gt; 3.8. Inheritance and Class Naming">8</a>. </span>Inheritance and Class Naming</h2>
		<div class="contents2">
			<p>A convention that is used often for UIZE subclasses is to put them under the namespace of their superclass.</p>
			
			<p>So, for example, the <code>Bar</code> subclass of <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Widget.html">Uize.Widget</a></code> is available as the static property <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Widget.Bar.html">Uize.Widget.Bar</a></code>, and the <code>Slider</code> subclass of <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Widget.Bar.html">Uize.Widget.Bar</a></code> is available as the static property <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Widget.Bar.Slider.html">Uize.Widget.Bar.Slider</a></code>. So, the names used to access classes can denote their inheritance relationship. Of course, any class may, in its implementation, use multiple orthogonal helper classes, and this cannot be conveyed in its naming.</p>
			
			<p>However, a module being assigned as a property on another module does not necessarily indicate an inheritance relationship, since modules can also be used as namespaces to host other modules. So, for example, the module name <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Data.html">Uize.Data</a></code> does not indicate that the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Data.html">Uize.Data</a></code> module is a subclass of the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.html">Uize</a></code> module. In fact, neither modules are class modules - the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.html">Uize</a></code> module is simply serving as a namespace for the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Data.html">Uize.Data</a></code> module. In another example, the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Util.PropertyAdapter.html">Uize.Util.PropertyAdapter</a></code> module defines a subclass of the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Class.html">Uize.Class</a></code> module, but it's kept under the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Util.html">Uize.Util</a></code> namespace.</p>

			<p>Don't be afraid of using nested functions, many levels of indentation, or creating large function bodies. The folding features of most modern editors and the high resolutions of modern displays makes this a breeze.</p>
			
			<p>In many respects it is more ideal to encapsulate helper functions within the exact scope in which they are used, rather than polluting a scope level higher up. That way, anyone trying to discover the code will only encounter the code of an encapsulated helper function once they dig into the function that uses it and doesn't need to be confronted with it any sooner (progressive disclosure).</p>
