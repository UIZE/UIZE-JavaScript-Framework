A new explainer for the state property mechanism provides an exhaustive explanation of state properties and digs into the nuances of features such as =onChange= handlers, =conformer= functions, initial values, the =Changed.[propertyName]= virtual event, and more.

Scores of examples are provided to illustrate the many facets of this powerful mechanism. Don't write a class for the UIZE JavaScript Framework without appreciating how to get the most out of state properties.
