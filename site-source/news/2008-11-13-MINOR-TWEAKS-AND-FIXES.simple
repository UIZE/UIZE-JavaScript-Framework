- A new =insertionMode= state property implemented in the =Uize.Widget= base class provides a way for applications to control how a widget's HTML is inserted when the =built= state property is set to =false= and a non-empty value is specified for the =html= state property. For more details, consult the reference for the =Uize.Widget= class.
- The [[../examples/slideshow-with-wipes.html][Slideshow With Wipes]] and [[../examples/slideshow.html][Slideshow]] examples have been updated to use JavaScript Template (.jst) files for building the HTML of the slideshow widget's UI.
- A bug in the =Uize.Widget.Button= class that was affecting the Firefox 2 and Opera browsers has been fixed. Basically, using the =text= state property of a button widget instance to change a button's label text was causing a button to become non-responsive when clicking on the =text= implied node (but not other parts of the button).
