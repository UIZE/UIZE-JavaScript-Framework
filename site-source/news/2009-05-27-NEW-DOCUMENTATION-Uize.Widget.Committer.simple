Reference documentation has been added for the =Uize.Widget.Committer= module.

The =Uize.Widget.Committer= module implements a subclass of =Uize.Widget= that can be used for watching a set of properties and committing them when a button is clicked. In a common case, the set of properties being watched might be the =value= state properties of a bunch of form input widgets. The committer instance acts as a conduit or interface between the watched properties and the code that cares about watching them.
