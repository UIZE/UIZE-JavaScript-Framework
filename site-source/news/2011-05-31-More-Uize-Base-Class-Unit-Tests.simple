More Uize Base Class Unit Tests
	To help ensure the robustness and stability of the UIZE JavaScript Framework over time, more unit tests have been created for the =Uize= base class.

	Event System Unit Tests
		The powerful event system of the UIZE JavaScript Framework, implemented in the =Uize= base class, is now thoroughly unit tested.

		This includes thorough unit tests for the =fire=, =wire=, and =unwire= instance methods, as well as the =Uize.fire=, =Uize.wire=, and =Uize.unwire= static methods.

	Other Static Method Unit Tests
		In addition to adding a thorough set of unit tests for the event system, unit tests have been added for the following static methods...

		- =Uize.copyInto=
		- =Uize.escapeRegExpLiteral=
		- =Uize.recordMatches=
		- =Uize.findRecordNo=
		- =Uize.findRecord=
		- =Uize.callOn=
