The new [[../examples/fade-quantization-chart.html][Fade Quantization Chart]] example illustrates, by way of a color chart representation, how the =quantization= state property of the =Uize.Fade= class affects a fade's interpolated value over the course of its progress.

In the example, a color is being faded from red to black over a series of swatches, from left to right. The color chart lets you visualize how different =quantization= settings for a fade could be used to generate color gradients with varying characteristics.
