The new [[../examples/collection-item-zooming-with-image-switching.html][Zooming Collection Item with Image Switching]] examples demonstrates how the =Uize.Widget.CollectionItem.Zooming= widget class handles dynamically switching the image that it displays.

In this example, the =Uize.Widget.CollectionItem.Zooming= widget class is being used to add a JavaScript animation zoom in effect to an image. In contrast to the [[../examples/collection-item-zooming.html][Zooming Collection Items]] example, which simply demonstrates this widget applied across multiple images in a grid, this example demonstrates how the value of a single instance's previewUrl state property can be changed dynamically, and how the zoom and pan behavior still works as expected after the image URL has been updated.
