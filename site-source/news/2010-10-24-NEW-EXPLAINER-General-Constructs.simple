The new [[../explainers/general-constructs.html][General Constructs]] explainer discusses a number of general constructs that apply across the entire UIZE JavaScript Framework, and can apply in application programming more generally.

Among the constructs discussed are: value transformers, value matchers, value conformers, and value validators. Each of these constructs is discussed in a good amount of detail, with code examples provided to illustrate how the constructs can be used.
