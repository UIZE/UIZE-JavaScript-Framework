The =once= instance method, implemented in the =Uize.Class= base class module, has been improved with support for optional condition inversion.

As a convenience, the =once= method now supports condition inversion through an optional "!" (logical not) prefix that can be placed before the condition name.

EXAMPLE
................................................................
myCollectionWidget.once (
	'!isEmpty',
	function () {
		// do something now that the collection is no longer empty
	}
);
................................................................

In the above example, code is being registered to execute once the =isEmpty= condition becomes false. This is done by prefixing the "isEmpty" condition name with a "!" (bang / exclamation) character to indicate that the code should execute only once the collection is not empty (ie. the value of the =isEmpty= state property becomes =false=). The `condition inversion` facility is convenient in situations like this where you wish to execute code only once a condition becomes unmet, rather than once the condition becomes met (which is the standard behavior for the =once= method).
