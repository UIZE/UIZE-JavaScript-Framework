Documentation has been added for the =insertUi= and =insertOrWire= instance methods, and the =idPrefixConstruction= state properties of the =Uize.Widget= module.

SUMMARY
- The =insertOrWireUi= instance method calls either the =wireUi= or =insertUi= instance method, depending on the value of the =built= state property.
- The =insertUi= instance method inserts the UI for an instance by calling the =buildHtml= instance method, and then wires the instance's UI by calling the =wireUi= method.
- The =idPrefixConstruction= state property is a string, specifying the mode of construction of the value for the =idPrefix= state property.
