The new =Uize.Widget.ListEditor= module implements a widget that lets the user build and edit a simple list of string values.

This module implements a number of noteworthy features:

- items added by the user can be conformed before being added to the list using a configurable =itemConformer= function
- the list can be maintained in a sorted state by using the =sort= state property
- special handling is implemented for the keyboard's enter, escape, and delete keys
- the state of the widget's =add= and =remove= button child widgets is managed so they are only enabled when appropriate
- the combination of the add and remove behaviors provides for a sufficiently intuitive way to make edits to items in the list
- and more...

The =Uize.Widget.ListEditor= module is actually not an entirely new module, but rather an evolution of the =Uize.Widget.TextInputAdder= module. The =Uize.Widget.TextInputAdder= module has been replaced by the =Uize.Widget.ListEditor= module, and this change in not backwards compatible.
