This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Widget.Swap= module.

- refactor to move basic wipe code into some other module
	- refactor various Zazzle classes that use this effect to instead use built in service
- handle switching transition settings during a transition (i.e. make sure all state is reflected correctly visually)
