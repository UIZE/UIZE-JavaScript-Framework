New State Properties
	- =breathe= - an amount of time that the test runner should pause after completion of a test
	- =cleanup= - code to execute upon completion of a test (different between success or failure?)
	- =context= - a context selector/filter that can be used by the test runner to determine if the test should be run in the current context (e.g. browser tests vs non-browser tests, tests specific to certain browsers, etc.)
	- =setup= - code to execute before running of a test

- should be possible for tests to declare that they can run outside of browser context
