	Introduction
		The =Uize.Util.Coupler= class implements a mechanism for coupling two or more instances of any =Uize.Class= subclass by synchronizing values of state properties.

		*DEVELOPERS:* `Chris van Rensburg`

		In a Nutshell
			The =Uize.Util.Coupler= class makes it easy to keep desired state synchronized between two or more instances.

			Coupled instances can be widget instances (ie. instances of =Uize.Widget= subclasses), but they do not have to be widgets. Coupled instances do not have to be of the same class - they only need to provide the same state properties that are to be synchronized between them.

		An Example
			Using the =Uize.Util.Coupler= class is easy: all you have to do is create an instance of it, specifying which properties of which instances you would like to be coupled together. Consider the following example...

			EXAMPLE
			......................................................................................
			// create subclass of Uize.Widget.CollectionItem.Zooming, for common property values

				var CollectionItemZoomingSubclass = Uize.Widget.CollectionItem.Zooming.subclass ();
				CollectionItemZoomingSubclass.set ({
					previewZoomUrl:function () {
						return this.get ('previewUrl').replace ('100x75','400x300');
					},
					zoomPower:4
				});


			// create some zooming collection item widgets

				var
					item0 = page.addChild ('item0',CollectionItemZoomingSubclass),
					item1 = page.addChild ('item1',CollectionItemZoomingSubclass),
					item2 = page.addChild ('item2',CollectionItemZoomingSubclass)
				;


			// couple the alignX, alignY, inUse properties between the collection items

				var coupler = Uize.Util.Coupler ({
					instances:[item0,item1,item2],
					properties:['alignX','alignY','inUse']
				});
			......................................................................................

			In the above example, a custom subclass of the =Uize.Widget.CollectionItem.Zooming= widget class is being created. This is done purely as a convenience, in order to capture some common state property values, and so that all instances of this subclass that are created will have those same initial values. Then, three instances of this custom subclass are added as child widgets to the page widget (which we assume in this example to already be defined).

			Finally, an instance of the =Uize.Util.Coupler= class is created in order to couple the three instances together by keeping the values of their =alignX=, =alignY=, and =inUse= state properties synchronized across the three of them. This has the effect of making the instance that the user is currently interacting with drive the other two instances - any instance can drive the other two. When the user rests the mouse over one of the instances, the zoom in effect will be activated for all three. And when the user moves the mouse over one in order to pan horizontally and vertically around the zoomed image, the two other instances will follow the lead of the one the user is mousing over.
