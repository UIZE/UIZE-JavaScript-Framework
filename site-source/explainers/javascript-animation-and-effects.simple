Introduction
	The UIZE JavaScript Framework provides powerful features to support slick animation effects, with easing, bounce, elasticity, pulsing, and much more.

	WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT ANIMATION?

	JavaScript animation is the animation of properties of the DOM, CSS style properties, or the properties of JavaScript objects, using JavaScript code to drive this animation.

	WHAT ALL CAN BE ANIMATED?

	Many visible properties of a document can be animated, such as color style properties (eg. =color=, =background=, =backgroundColor=, =borderColor=, etc.), position style properties (eg. =top=, =right=, =bottom=, =left=, =backgroundPosition=), padding and margin style properties (eg. =padding=, =paddingTop=, =paddingRight=, =paddingBottom=, =paddingLeft=, =margin=, =marginTop=, etc.), dimension style properties (eg. =width=, =height=, =maxWidth=, =maxHeigh=, =borderWidth=, =borderTopWidth=, etc.), and font style properties (eg. =fontSize=, =letterSpacing=, =wordSpacing=, =lineHeight=, =textIndent=).

	In addition, the UIZE JavaScript Framework lets you animate the values of state properties for instances of =Uize.Class= subclasses, calls to methods, and calls to arbitrary functions. So, beyond just visible style properties of a document, you can animate state of anything. And you're not even limited to time-based effects - you can even use the effects system to produce color gradients and other `non-time based fades`.

	HOW'S THE PERFORMANCE?

	The animation system of the UIZE JavaScript Framework is optimized for performance, using many tricks and techniques. Performance is surprisingly good (as you'll see from some of the examples), and browsers are improving all the time and machines are getting more powerful. Basically, things are generally looking up for animation and effects built using Web standards.

	ANIMATION IS A KIND OF FADE

	Some people may think of an opacity fade when they hear the term "fade" used, but in the UIZE JavaScript Framework the term "fade" refers to any kind of cross-fade between one state and another. This would include color fades, position fades, size fades, opacity fades, etc. Animations are really just a specific type of fade - a time-based fade - and not all fades need to occur over time (more on that later). Some people also use terms such as "interpolation", or "tweening". UIZE uses the term "fade", so prepare to encounter it with this meaning all throughout the documentation.

Some Examples

The Engine
	The engine for animation and fade effects in the UIZE JavaScript Framework is the =Uize.Fade= class.

	All classes or modules that implement some form of animation ultimately rely on the =Uize.Fade= class. So, even when you're not using the =Uize.Fade= class directly, it's worth understanding the principles of this class, since it's used to drive so many diverse animations throughout various parts of the framework. Learning the basic mechanics of this class will take you a long way towards understanding all animation effects.

	In a Nutshell
		In simple terms, the =Uize.Fade= class interpolates a value between a start value and an end value.

		When this interpolation is driven by its timer, an instance of this class can be used to control an animation over time. Code that uses a =Uize.Fade= instance can wire handlers for various events in order to be notified when value updates - and other key state changes - occur. Let's consider a simple example...

		EXAMPLE
		...................................................................................
		var myFade = Uize.Fade ({startValue:0,endValue:100,duration:5000});
		myFade.wire ('Changed.value',function () {Uize.Node.setValue ('testNode',myFade)});
		myFade.start ();
		...................................................................................

		In the above example, a value will be faded between =0= and =100= over a period of =5000= milliseconds (5 seconds) when the =start= instance method is called. In order to have something noticeable happen during the fade, a handler is wired to the =Changed.value= instance event - an event that is fired each time the =value= state property is updated (if you need a refresher on the =Change.[propertyName] Virtual Event=, consult the [[state-properties.html][State Properties]] explainer and read through the `Changed Events` section).

		In this case, the handler code simply displays the current value in the DOM node with the =id= of ='testNode'=, using the =Uize.Node.setValue= static method of the =Uize.Node= module. We can pass just the reference to =myFade= here because the =Uize.Node.setValue= method will coerce it to a string and thereby invoke the =valueOf Intrinsic Method= which returns the value of the =value= state property - a nice little shorthand. Now, if we didn't wire a handler to this event, then the value would still fade when the =start= method was called, but nobody would see that anything was happening.

	Key Features
		The =Uize.Fade= class supports the following key features...

		- `Quantization` - In order to provide safe values for code that uses fades, and in order to improve performance, interpolated values can be quantized using the highly flexible quantization feature.

		- `Compound Value Interpolation` - Start and end values for a fade don't need to be exclusively simple number type values - they can be arrays of numbers, or arrays of arrays of numbers, or objects containing numbers, etc.

		- `Curves` - Linear is boring. The =Uize.Fade= class lets you supply arbitrary curve functions in order to produce animations that emulate the complex properties of motion, letting you achieve effects like bounce, springiness, wobble, elasticity, etc.

		- `Non-time Based Fades` - Fades do not need to occur exclusively in the time domain. You can use the =Uize.Fade= class to produce color gradients, to lay out an array of DOM nodes, etc.

		- other utility features, such as its =Uize.Fade.blendValues= static method that lets you interpolate between two simple or compound values, without having to first create a =Uize.Fade= instance.

	Quantization
		In order to provide safe values for code that uses fades, and in order to improve performance, interpolated values can be quantized using the highly flexible quantization feature.

		The =Uize.Fade= class provides a highly versatile mechanism for configuring aribtrary quantization. In our earlier example that displayed an interpolated number in the range of =0= to =100= in a DOM node during the fade, there was no quantization. Consequently, you would see all manner of floating point number displayed throughout the course of the fade. If we were instead using this interpolated value to set something like left position, measured in pixels, then we wouldn't have a healthy value. And even if we rounded the number in our =Changed.value= event handler code, or if the browser forgave floating point pixel measurements, we would still potentially be touching the DOM far more than we would need to - the fractional values will not be noticeable but the unnecessary updates will cost us in performance. This is where the =quantization= state property of the =Uize.Fade= class comes in. Consider an updated version of the earlier example...

		EXAMPLE
		...................................................................................
		var myFade = Uize.Fade ({startValue:0,endValue:100,duration:5000,quantization:1});
		myFade.wire ('Changed.value',function () {Uize.Node.setValue ('testNode',myFade)});
		myFade.start ();
		...................................................................................

		By setting the value of the =quantization= state property to =1=, we are ensuring that the value of the =value= state property will always be in increments of =1=. Since the start value is an integer, this will ensure that the interpolated value at any given point in time will always be an integer. Now when the =start= method is called, you would only see integers displayed throughout the course of the fade.

	Compound Value Interpolation
		Possibly one of the most powerful features of the =Uize.Fade= class is its support for interpolation of compound values.

		Start and end values for a fade don't need to be exclusively simple number type values - they can be arrays of numbers, or arrays of arrays of numbers, or objects containing properties with number values, etc. Consider the very practical use case of animating the coordinates of an absolutely positioned DOM node over time by fading the values of its =left=, =top=, =width=, and =height= CSS style properties...

		EXAMPLE
		.........................................................................
		var positionFade = Uize.Fade ({
			startValue:{left:0,top:0,width:10,height:10},
			endValue:{left:100,top:100,width:200,height:200},
			duration:2000,
			quantization:1
		});
		positionFade.wire (
			'Changed.value',
			function () {Uize.Node.setStyle ('myNode',positionFade.get ('value'))}
		);
		positionFade.start ();
		.........................................................................

		In the above example, the DOM node with the =id= of ='myNode'= is being moved and resized, starting from a position of 0,0 and a size of 10 x 10, and ending up at the position of 100,100 and a size of 200 x 200. Because the values of the =startValue= and =endValue= state properties are both objects containing the properties =left=, =top=, =width=, and =height=, so the value of the =value= state property is also an object containing these properties. The =Uize.Node.setStyle= static method conveniently accepts an object with an arbitrary number of properties for different CSS style properties, and =left=, =top=, =width=, and =height= happen to be valid names of CSS style properties. Furthermore, this method resolves numerical values for coordinate properties by appending the unit string ='px'=. So we're golden - we can just pass the value of the fade's =value= state property to the =Uize.Node.setStyle= method and it will position and resize the DOM node as desired.

		Now this, of course, is *not* the most concise way to animate coordinates using the UIZE JavaScript Framework - the framework provides convenient modules for easily `animating CSS style properties` - but this example illustrates the benefit of interpolating compound values. And those other, more convenient features for easily animating CSS properties rely on this mechanism, anyway.

		Now let's consider a slightly more complex example - one where we want to animate both the coordinates *and* background color of a DOM node using the same =Uize.Fade= instance...

		EXAMPLE
		.................................................................................
		var positionAndBgFade = Uize.Fade ({
			startValue:{
				coords:{left:0,top:0,width:10,height:10},
				bg:{red:255,green:165,blue:0}
			},
			endValue:{
				coords:{left:0,top:0,width:10,height:10},
				bg:{red:128,green:0,blue:128}
			},
			duration:2000,
			quantization:1
		});
		positionAndBgFade.wire (
			'Changed.value',
			function () {
				var
					value = positionAndBgFade.get ('value'),
					bg = value.bg
				;
				Uize.Node.setStyle ('myNode',value.coords);
				Uize.Node.setStyle (
					'myNode',
					{backgroundColor:'rgb(' + bg.red + ',' + bg.green + ',' + bg.blue + ')'}
				);
			}
		);
		positionAndBgFade.start ();
		.................................................................................

		Now the values for the =startValue= and =endValue= state properties have even more in them - this time separate =coords= and =bg= properties, where both =coords= and =bg= are objects. No problem, the =Uize.Fade= class can handle it all. The value of the =value= state property, that is interpolated between =startValue= and =endValue=, will have the same structure as =startValue= and =endValue=. In the handler for the =Change.value= event, the code is indexing into this interpolated compound value to get the interpolated values for =coords= and =bg=, which it is then using separately to set the coordinates and background color for the node. With the interpolated background color tuple object it is forming a string of the form "rgb([red],[green],[blue])" for setting the =backgroundColor= CSS style property.

		Now, once again, there *are* more convient ways to do this in a single statement using the =Uize.Fx= module, but this example illustrates the versatility of `compound value interpolation`.

		Compound Values and Compound Quantization
			Along with `compound value interpolation`, the =Uize.Fade= class also supports compound quantization.

			In the previous example that showed how quantization is used, the quantization value of =1= was being used for the interpolation of all components of the compound value. But, what if different parts of a compound value need different quantization? Say, for example, we wanted to use a single =Uize.Fade= instance to animate both the opacity and color of a DOM node. If we used the value =1= for quantizing the opacity value (a floating point number in the range of =0= to =1=), then it could only ever be the integers =0= or =1=. In such cases, it is possible to specify a compound value for the =quantization= state property. Consider the following example...

			EXAMPLE
			..................................................................................
			var positionAndBgFade = Uize.Fade ({
				startValue:{opacity:1,bg:{red:255,green:165,blue:0}},
				endValue:{opacity:0,bg:{red:128,green:0,blue:128}},
				duration:2000,
				quantization:{bg:1}
			});
			positionAndBgFade.wire (
				'Changed.value',
				function () {
					var
						value = positionAndBgFade.get ('value'),
						bg = value.bg
					;
					Uize.Node.setStyle (
						'myNode',
						{
							opacity:value.opacity,
							backgroundColor:'rgb(' + bg.red + ',' + bg.green + ',' + bg.blue + ')'
						}
					);
				}
			);
			positionAndBgFade.start ();
			..................................................................................

			Now we have a quantization value of =1= for the =bg= part of the interpolated value, but no quantization specified for the =opacity= part (so it defaults to no quantization). Of course, life is made more convenient by the =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= method of the =Uize.Fx= module, where it is not necessary to worry about which CSS style properties need which quantization and where the above task could be accomplished in a single statement, but this example is to illustrate the principle.

	### to discuss
		- features of implementation
			- timing integrity
			- optimized for performance
			- single timer "thread"
		- note how many of the other classes that offer animations may allow the qualities of the animation to be configured by use of a fadePropertiesOBJ parameter. Cite some example.

The Fade Factory
	The UIZE JavaScript Framework provides a higher level construct for initiating fades without having to deal directly with the =Uize.Fade= class.

	In the section `The Engine` we looked at the most atomic unit of animations: an instance of the =Uize.Fade= class. When using the =Uize.Fade= class directly, it is your responsibility to keep track of the fade instances you create, wire event handlers for them, start them and and stop them as desired, etc. For certain situations where you just want to quickly kick off an animation and where your code doesn't have a long-term interest in holding on to the =Uize.Fade= instance used to service the animation, the =Uize.Fade.xFactory= extension module comes in, providing a number of useful factory methods for initiating fades in a carefree manner.

	EXAMPLE
	......................................................................................
	Uize.Fade.fade (
		function (value) {Uize.Node.setStyle ('myNode',value)},  // update handler function
		{left:0,top:0,width:10,height:10},                       // start value
		{left:100,top:100,width:200,height:200},                 // end value
		2000,                                                    // duration
		{quantization:1}                                         // extra fade properties
	);
	......................................................................................

	The above example is a reformulation of the first example shown in the `compound Value Interpolation` section, to now use the =Uize.Fade.fade= static method that is defined in the =Uize.Fade.xFactory= extension module. If you compare the two examples, you will notice that this one is shorter. It's still not as short as it could be, because we're not using the convenient =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= static method that's defined in the =Uize.Fx= module and that's designed specifically for the purpose of making `animating CSS style properties` dead simple. It is, however, shorter than the example that directly uses the =Uize.Fade= class, because it leaves it to the =Uize.Fade.fade= method to create the =Uize.Fade= instance, wire event handlers, and start the fade.

	Looking at the example, you should notice a few important things:

	+. The first parameter is the update handler function, and it receives the interpolated value as its parameter.
	+. The second and third parameters are the start and end values for the fade, respectively (ie. the values for the =Uize.Fade= instance's =startValue= and =endValues= state properties).
	+. The fourth parameter is the fade's duration (ie. the value for the =Uize.Fade= instance's =duration= state property).
	+. The last parameter is for additional state property values that should be set on the =Uize.Fade= instance before the fade is started (in this case we're using it to set =quantization=).

	Non-interpolated Values
		The interpolation of compound values by the =Uize.Fade= class ignores parts of the compound value that are the same between the start and end values.

		So, for example, if the start value was the array =['myNode',1]= and the end value was the array =['myNode',0]=, then the first element of the interpolated array would not be interpolated, because the value of this element in the compound start value is the same as its value in the compound end value. This is just as well, too, because interpolating between two string values would be a bit of a challenge. So, for all values interpolated between the compound start and end values, the value of the first element of the array would always be ='myNode'=.

		This particular behavior comes in handy when we want to interpolate an arguments array for a function call, between a start arguments array and an end arguments array. Consider the following example...

		EXAMPLE
		.....................................................................
		Uize.Fade.fade (Uize.Node.setOpacity,['myNode',1],['myNode',0],2000);
		.....................................................................

		In the above example, we are animating calls to the =Uize.Node.setOpacity= static method defined in the =Uize.Node= module in order to fade the opacity of the node with the =id= of ='myNode'= from =1= to =0= over a period of =2000= milliseconds (2 seconds). The start and end values for the fade are arguments arrays for the function call, with the first argument specifying the DOM node and the second argument specifying the opacity level. What is interpolated for each update of the fade is an arguments array where the first element will always be ='myNode'=, and the second element will be an interpolated floating point number in the range of =1= to =0=.

		This principle applies fundamentally to the way that the =Uize.Fade= class does interpolation, so we get the benefit of it in the =Uize.Fade.fade= static method - and all the other factory static methods that are implemented by the =Uize.Fade.xFactory= module - because the =Uize.Fade.xFactory= module is built on top of the =Uize.Fade= class.

	### Fade Pool
		there's more to the carefree initiation of fades than just wiring event handlers and calling start
		managing a pool of fades

	### Fade Signature
		- same context, same handler, same structure for start and end values, and parts of start and end values that are the same in active fade must also be the same in new fade and be the same as the values for the active fade
		- it's a heuristic, which is how you get out of having to explicitly manage =Uize.Fade= instances and start and stop them manually and coordinate across different code that may try to animate the same things

	Fading a Function Call
		In the most basic case, you may wish to animate the calling of an update function.

		In such cases, the generic =Uize.Fade.fade= static method will do the job. For this method, the start value can be an array that represents the values for the arguments of the function call at the start of the fade. Similarly, the end value can be an array for the arguments at the end of the fade. At every update, the =Uize.Fade= class will interpolate an arguments set, whose values are somewhere between the arguments' values at the start and end of the fade, and then supply that interpolated arguments set to the function when calling it. Consider the following example...

		EXAMPLE
		............................................
		Uize.Fade.fade (scrollTo,[0,0],[0,200],500);
		............................................

		In the above example, the vertical scroll position of the document will be faded from =0= to =200= over a half second.

		The =scrollTo= function is a property of the =window= object - it really doesn't have to be called as a method on the =window= object. It takes two parameters: left scroll position, and top scroll position. Using the =Uize.Fade.fade= method to fade calls to this function, a start parameter list of =[0,0]= is specified, and an end parameter list of =[0,200]= is specified. This has the effect of fading the scroll position of the window from 0,0 to 0,200. In this example, the left scroll position is the same at the start and end of the fade, but there's no saying that it has to be.

		Being able to easily fade function calls with interpolated argument lists is very powerful and makes it easy to do quite a lot in just a short statement. In another example, one could achieve a window roll down effect with a statement like =Uize.Fade.fade (resizeTo,[1024,0],[1024,768],1000)=.

		Fading Anonymous Function Calls
			There's no saying that a function that is being faded using the =Uize.Fade.fade= method has to be a named function - it could just as well be anonymous.

			For an example of this, refer back to the first example of the section `The Fade Factory`.

		Fading Static Methods As Functions
			For fading static methods, one can usually just use the =Uize.Fade.fade= method.

			This is because most static methods don't care about the context on which they are called and are really just static properties that happen to be references to functions. This is the case with most of the static methods defined in package modules, such as the =Uize.Node.setOpacity= static method of the =Uize.Node= module. So, the following two statements would be equivalent...

			.............................................................................
			Uize.Fade.fade (Uize.Node.setOpacity,['myNode',1],['myNode',0],2000);

			Uize.Fade.fadeMethod (Uize.Node,'setOpacity',['myNode',1],['myNode',0],2000);
			.............................................................................

			In the above example, both statements would have the effect of fading the opacity of the node with the =id= of ='myNode'= from =1= to =0= over a period of =2000= milliseconds (2 seconds). The first statement is animating calls to the function =Uize.Node.setOpacity=, while the second statement is animating calling the method =setOpacity= on the context =Uize.Node=. Now, the implementation of the =Uize.Node.setOpacity= static method does not use the =this= keyword, so the context that it is called on does not affect its execution. So, one may as well just animate the opacity using the `fading a function call` approach. As you can see, in such cases the =Uize.Fade.fadeMethod= method does not even produce the most concise code.

			IMPORTANT

			An exception to this rule would be certain class methods that behave differently, depending upon which class they're called on, or that modify or access properties specific to the class on which they're called. So, the following two examples would most certainly *NOT* be equivalent...

			INCORRECT
			.......................................................................
			Uize.Fade.fade (Uize.Widget.Bar.Slider.set,{value:0},{value:100},2000);

			CORRECT
			...............................................................................
			Uize.Fade.fadeMethod (Uize.Widget.Bar.Slider,'set',{value:0},{value:100},2000);
			...............................................................................

			The first example will simply not work - period. That's because the =Uize.Widget.Bar.Slider.set= method needs a class as a context, and by using the =Uize.Fade.fade= method it will simply be called as a function - without a context. The approach using the =Uize.Fade.fadeMethod= method works, because the context =Uize.Widget.Bar.Slider= is specified using the first parameter and this context is remembered for when the =set= method is to be called. Admittedly, you're not likely to want to fade the setting of the value for a state property on a class, but this example at least illustrates the point.

			In cases where you need to animate the calling of a particular method on a particular context, you can use the =Uize.Fade.fadeMethod= static method, as discussed in the section `Fading a Method Call`.

		Fading Uize.Node Method Calls
			The =Uize.Fade.fade= static method lets you animate calls to any arbitrary function, including static methods of the =Uize.Node= module that don't need to be called with =Uize.Node= as the context (see `Fading Static Methods As Functions`).

			EXAMPLE
			.........................................................................
			Uize.Fade.fade (Uize.Node.setValue,['testNode',0],['testNode',100],5000);
			.........................................................................

			In the above example, a value will be faded between =0= and =100= over a period of =5000= milliseconds (5 seconds) and this value will be displayed in the DOM node with the =id= of ='testNode'=. The =Uize.Node.setValue= method takes two arguments - the first for the DOM node, and the second for the value. Because the value of the first parameter is the same between the start value arguments array and the end value arguments array, its value is not interpolated and is always ='testNode'=.

	Fading a Method Call
		There may be cases where you would like to animate the calling of a method - either on an instance or on a class.

		Of course, in such cases, you could always use the generic =Uize.Fade.fade= static method for initiating a genertic fade and then specify an anonymous function as the update handler, and then your update function could call the method, relying on the fact that the context and method name are known in the enclosing scope of the anonymous function. Well, you could always do that, but you do not need to - the =Uize.Fade.xFactory= module implements a =Uize.Fade.fadeMethod= static method that does just the job.

		EXAMPLE
		............................................................................
		Uize.Fade.fadeMethod (marquee,'set',{left:0,top:0},{left:100,top:100},2000);
		............................................................................

		The above example animates the position of a marquee widget (an instance of the =Uize.Widget.Resizer.Marquee= class) from 0,0 to 100,100 over a period of =2000= milliseconds (2 seconds). With the =Uize.Fade.fadeMethod= method, the first parameter is the context or object on which the method should be called, and the second parameter is the name of the method to call, or a reference to the function that implements the method.

		If you had to write the above code using the generic =Uize.Fade.fade= method, it would be a bit longer, as follows...

		................................................................................
		Uize.Fade.fade (
			function (value) {marquee.set (value)},{left:0,top:0},{left:100,top:100},2000
		);
		................................................................................

		Fading Static Methods
			For fading static methods, it is not usually necessary to use the =Uize.Fade.fadeMethod= method.

			This is explained in more detail in the section `Fading Static Methods As Functions`.

		Specifying Method to Fade
			When using the =Uize.Fade.fadeMethod= method, you have flexibility in how you specify the method you wish to fade.

			The value for the second parameter of the =Uize.Fade.fadeMethod= method can be a string, being the name of the method to call, or a reference to the method's function. When specifying a function reference for this parameter, the reference can be accessed from the prototype of the class of the instance (if it is an instance method), or it can be referenced from the instance (if it is an instance method), or it can be accessed from the class (if it is a class method), or it may be a function that is not a method of the instance but that one would like to be called as though it were a method of the instance, such as an anonymous function or a method of some other class.

			In the following example, where we wish to fade a call to the =set= instance method of the instance =slider=, any of the statements would do the trick...

			EXAMPLE
			.....................................................................................
			// method specified using a string value
			Uize.Fade.fadeMethod (slider,'set',{value:0},{value:100},2000);


			// method specified by function reference, accessing it from the instance
			Uize.Fade.fadeMethod (slider,slider.set,{value:0},{value:100},2000);


			// method specified by function reference, accessed from instance's class' prototype
			Uize.Fade.fadeMethod (slider,slider.Class.prototype.set,{value:0},{value:100},2000);


			// method specified by function reference, accessed from instance's class' prototype
			Uize.Fade.fadeMethod (
				slider,Uize.Widget.Bar.Slider.prototype.set,{value:0},{value:100},2000
			);


			// method is an anonymous function that is called on the instance as a method
			Uize.Fade.fadeMethod (slider,function (value) {this.set ({value:value})},0,100,2000);
			.....................................................................................

			Naturally, the first statement of the above set is the most preferable, but who knows how you might get access to the method to be faded in your own code. This example simply illustrates that you have options, and flexibility.

	Fading the value State Property
		The =Uize.Fade.fade= static method that is implemented in the =Uize.Fade.xFactory= extension module supports special handling when the target of a fade is an instance of a =Uize.Class= subclass.

		What does it mean to fade an instance? When an instance is specified in place of an update function when calling the =Uize.Fade.fade= method, this method fades the value of the specified instance's =value= state property. So, if the class of your instance implements a =value= state property, then you can use this convenient shorthand. Consider the following example...

		EXAMPLE
		...................................
		Uize.Fade.fade (slider,0,100,2000);
		...................................

		In the above example, =slider= is an instance of the =Uize.Widget.Bar.Slider= class, and this class has a =value= state property. So, the statement will have the effect of fading the value of the slider widget from =0= to =100= over a period of =2000= milliseconds (2 seconds) - short 'n sweet. Of course, you could accomplish the same effect by `fading a method call` or by `fading a state property`, as in...

		...............................................................
		// fading the slider value by fading a method call
		Uize.Fade.fadeMethod (slider,'set',{value:0},{value:100},2000);

		// fading the slider value by fading a state property
		Uize.Fade.fadeProperty (slider,'value',0,100,2000);
		...............................................................

		But, why would you want to write more code, if you could avoid it?

	Fading a State Property
		While the =Uize.Fade.fade= static method can be used for `fading the value state property`, fading a state property other than the =value= property can be accomplished using the =Uize.Fade.fadeProperty= static method.

		EXAMPLE
		.....................................................
		Uize.Fade.fadeProperty (marquee,'width',10,100,2000);
		.....................................................

		In the above example, =marquee= is an instance of the =Uize.Widget.Resizer.Marquee= class. The statement will fade the value of its =width= state property from =10= to =200= over a period of =2000= milliseconds (2 seconds).

	Fading Many State Properties
		While the =Uize.Fade.fadeProperty= static method can be used for `fading a state property`, fading values for multiple state properties of an instance in a single fade can be accomplished using the =Uize.Fade.fadeProperties= static method.

		EXAMPLE
		....................................................................................
		Uize.Fade.fadeProperties (marquee,{width:10,height:10},{width:100,height:100},2000);
		....................................................................................

		In the above example, =marquee= is an instance of the =Uize.Widget.Resizer.Marquee= class. The statement will fade its dimensions (ie. the values of its =width= and =height= state properties) from 10 x 10 to 100 x 100 over a period of =2000= milliseconds (2 seconds).

		Now, for what it's worth, you could also accomplish the same effect using the =Uize.Fade.fadeMethod= method, as follows...

		......................................................................................
		Uize.Fade.fadeMethod (marquee,'set',{width:10,height:10},{width:100,height:100},2000);
		......................................................................................

		As you can see, using the =Uize.Fade.fadeProperties= method isn't that much shorter, so it's offered more as a semantic convenience - use whichever makes more sense to you.

		Fading From Current Values
			To fade state properties from their current values to new values, simply specify the value =null= for the =Uize.Fade.fadeProperties= method's =propertiesStartValuesOBJ= parameter, as in...

			EXAMPLE
			....................................................................
			Uize.Fade.fadeProperties (marquee,null,{width:100,height:100},2000);
			....................................................................

			The above example fades the dimensions of =marquee= from the current dimensions to 100 x 100 over a period of =2000= milliseconds (2 seconds).

		Fading Back To Current Values
			To fade state properties from new values back to their current values, simply specify the value =null= for the =Uize.Fade.fadeProperties= method's =propertiesEndValuesOBJ= parameter, as in...

			EXAMPLE
			....................................................................
			Uize.Fade.fadeProperties (marquee,{width:100,height:100},null,2000);
			....................................................................

			The above example fades the dimensions of =marquee= from 100 x 100 back to the current dimensions to over a period of =2000= milliseconds (2 seconds).

		Mixed From / Back To Current
			The =Uize.Fade.fadeProperties= method also supports fading certain state properties from their current values to new values, and other state properties from new values back to their current values - in the same fade process.

			Basically, when specifying the values of state properties in either of the =propertiesStartValuesOBJ= or =propertiesEndValuesOBJ= parameters, specifying the value =null= for any property, or omitting that property when it is specified for the opposite end of the fade, will result in the current value of that property being used. Consider the following example...

			.................................................................
			Uize.Fade.fadeProperties (marquee,{width:100},{height:100},2000);
			.................................................................

			In the above example, the =width= of the =marquee= instance is being faded from =100= back to its current value, while the =height= is being faded from its current value to =100=, over a period of =2000= milliseconds (2 seconds). Because a value is not specified for =width= in the =propertiesEndValuesOBJ= parameter, its current value is used as the end value. And because a value is not specified for =height= in the =propertiesStartValuesOBJ= parameter, its current value is used as the start value.

		### Passing the Baton
			- ability of one property or properties fade to assume responsibility for fading values of any state properties in new fade that are currently being faded by any active fades of the same property on the same instance
			- applies to any state properties being faded, regardless of how the fade was initiated: `fading the value state property`, `fading a state property`, or `fading many state properties`

	### The Most Generic Fade
		- ability to specify context and handler in target object

Animating CSS Style Properties
	While the =Uize.Fade.xFactory= extension module provides factory static methods for easily initiating generic kinds of animations, the UIZE JavaScript Framework also provides features specifically to ease the animation of CSS style properties.

	Arbitrary Properties
		Many compelling effects can be achieved by animating the values of the wide array of CSS style properties that can be modified by JavaScript code.

		Instead of having to cobble together more complex animations using multiple concurrent fades, the =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= method lets you fade the values of any number of CSS style properties in a single fade - right off the bat. Consider the following example....

		EXAMPLE
		..........................................................................................
		Uize.Fx.fadeStyle (
			'myNode',{left:0,top:0,width:10,height:10},{left:100,top:100,width:200,height:200},2000
		);
		..........................................................................................

		In the above example, the DOM node with the =id= of ='myNode'= is being moved and resized, starting from a position of 0,0 and a size of 10 x 10, and ending up at the position of 100,100 and a size of 200 x 200. If you contrast this code against the code shown in the example in the section `Compound Value Interpolation`, you'll notice that the convenient =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= method makes things much more concise when it comes to animating CSS style properties.

	Animating a Single CSS Style Property
		Fading the value of one style property is just the same as fading the values for multiple - only there'll be just one property in the start and end value objects. Consider the following example...

		EXAMPLE
		..........................................................
		Uize.Fx.fadeStyle ('myNode',{opacity:1},{opacity:0},2000);
		..........................................................

		In the above example, we are fading the opacity of the node with the =id= of ='myNode'= from =1= to =0= over a period of =2000= milliseconds (2 seconds).

	Key Features
		The =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= static method has the following key features...

		- *Supports a Wide Variety of CSS Style Properties* - The =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= method supports fading values for the following CSS style properties: =color=, =background=, =backgroundColor=, =borderColor=, =borderTopColor=, =borderRightColor=, =borderBottomColor=, =borderLeftColor=, =top=, =right=, =bottom=, =left=, =backgroundPosition=, =padding=, =paddingTop=, =paddingRight=, =paddingBottom=, =paddingLeft=, =margin=, =marginTop=, =marginRight=, =marginBottom=, =marginLeft=, =width=, =height=, =maxWidth=, =maxHeigh=, =borderWidth=, =borderTopWidth=, =borderRightWidth=, =borderBottomWidth=, =borderLeftWidth=, =fontSize=, =letterSpacing=, =wordSpacing=, =lineHeight=, =textIndent=

		- *Flexibility in Specifying Color Values* - Because the =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= method uses the =Uize.Color= object in its implementation, it provides all the flexibility in specifying color values for color CSS style properties that one gets when using the =Uize.Color= object.

		- *Builds Upon Uize.Fade* - Because the =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= method ultimately uses the =Uize.Fade= class in its implementation, style fades initiated using this method can be further qualified by specifying additional fade properties (such as a =curve= property) in its optional =fadePropertiesOBJ= parameter.

		- *Handles Quantization* - The =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= method takes care of quantization for CSS style properties whose values should be integers, such as position and dimension values measured in pixels.

		- *From Current Values, Back To Current Values, and Mixed* - The =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= method supports fades that start from the current style property values - as derived from the DOM node - and fade to specified values, fades that start from specified values and fade back to the current values, and fades where some properties fade from current to specified values and other properties fade from specified values to current values.

	Animating CSS3 Style Properties
		At the time of writing, most of the style properties defined in the CSS Level 3 specification are not yet supported in the majority of Web browsers in use.

		An exception to this is the =opacity= property, which is officially part of the CSS3 specification but has nevertheless been supported in a number of browsers for quite some time.

		CSS3 Animation Support in Extension Modules
			Because support for all CSS3 style properties is likely to take some time to become pervasive, support for these properties is not built directly into the base modules that support CSS animation in the UIZE JavaScript Framework - support is instead provided in the form of extension modules.

			Animating Text Shadow
				An example of CSS3 style property support through extension modules is the =Uize.Fx.xShadows= module, which supports fading all the properties of a box shadow or an arbitrary number of text shadows for DOM nodes.

				Fading values for the box shadow or text shadows of DOM nodes can produce some spectacular effects, but such effects can be considered esoteric enough that the weight of the framework should not be increased for the majority of use cases for the sake of supporting shadow animation. In cases where shadow animation is desired, it is easy enough to simply load the =Uize.Fx.xShadows= module.

			Extension Module Support Benefits Many
				Once an extension module that provides support for animating certain CSS3 style properties is loaded, then all modules that use the =Uize.Fx= module in their implementation will get the benefit of being able to animate the supported CSS3 style properties.

				For example, after loading the =Uize.Fx.xShadows= module, the =Uize.Widget.HoverFader= widget class will support default and hover styles that contain text shadow and/or box shadow properties. Good demonstrations of this are the [[../examples/hover-fader-text-shadow-animation.html][Hover Fader Text Shadow Animation]] and [[../examples/animated-buttons-with-box-shadow.html][Animated Buttons with Box Shadow]] examples.

	Advanced Techniques
		The way that the =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= method packs the values of all the style properties to be faded into compound start and end values, and the fact that it's possible to specify a compound value for the =curve= fade property, make some interesting techniques possible.

		If you're fading multiple style properties in a single fade, the ability to specify a compound value for the =curve= fade property lets you specify different `curve functions` for different of the style properties being faded. Consider the following example....

		EXAMPLE
		.......................................................................................
		Uize.Fx.fadeStyle (
			'myNode',
			{borderTopColor:'0',borderRightColor:'0',borderBottomColor:'0',borderLeftColor:'0'},
			{borderTopColor:'f',borderRightColor:'f',borderBottomColor:'f',borderLeftColor:'f'},
			3000,
			{curve:{
				borderLeftColor:Uize.Curve.Mod.band (1,.25,0),
				borderTopColor:Uize.Curve.Mod.band (1,.25,1/3),
				borderRightColor:Uize.Curve.Mod.band (1,.25,2/3),
				borderBottomColor:Uize.Curve.Mod.band (1,.25,1)
			}}
		);
		.......................................................................................

		In the above example, we are fading the border color of the top, left, right, and bottom borders from black to white, over a period of =3000= milliseconds (3 seconds). When the fade has completed, the entire border will be white all around. However, because we're accomplishing this by fading the four discrete CSS border color properties, we get the ability to specify different curves for each using a compoung value for the =curve= fade property, whose value is an object with the same structure as the start and end values of the fade. There is an entry in the =curve= object for each of the style properties being faded. In this case, we're using the =Uize.Curve.Mod.band= curve function generator defined in the =Uize.Curve.Mod= module so that each of the borders' white "comes in" at different points in the fade. Because of the values we've used in this example, the border would fade to white in a clockwise fashion, starting from the left border.

		Color Component Curves
			The way that the =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= method resolves color values to tuples that make their way into the compound start and end values of a style fade makes it possible to specify different `curve functions` for the different components of a color.

			This provides a way to achieve subtle color transitions, where your start and end colors are always simple, but the colors that are faded through in the course of a fade produce elegant effects. Consider the following example...

			EXAMPLE
			.......................................
			Uize.Fx.fadeStyle (
				'myNode',
				{borderColor:'0'},
				{borderColor:'f'},
				3000,
				{curve:{
					borderColor:[
						Uize.Curve.Mod.band (1,.4,0),
						Uize.Curve.Mod.band (1,.4,.5),
						Uize.Curve.Mod.band (1,.5,1)
					]
				}}
			);
			.......................................

			In the above example, the entire border is being faded from black to white over a period of =3000= milliseconds (3 seconds). We're specifying a =curve= fade property, with a value for the =borderColor= style property. Because we know that the =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= method resolves a color style property value into a tuple array, we can specify an array for the =borderColor= curve, where each element of the array is a different curve function.

			Fading the different components of the color along different curves through the course of the fade will result in the color not fading from black to white through various shades of gray, but instead producing different color tones along the way. In this example, the curves specified would produce the effect of the border color transitioning through hot colors before settling at pure white at the end. This is because the three band curves are making the red transition biased towards the start, green sitting in the middle, and blue biased towards the end. So, you see more red in the border color initially, and then it "cools off" as it approaches white.

			Color Component Curves in Action
				A good example of color component curves in action is the [[../examples/hover-fader-color-effects.html][Hover Fader Color Effects]] example.

				This example demonstrates how the =Uize.Widget.HoverFader= class (which uses the =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= method in its implementation) can be used to create stunning menu animation effects that employ non-linear color transitions.

Curves
	Linear is Boring
		Let's face it: linear is boring. And besides, it's just not how the real world behaves.

		To add some pizazz to animations, The UIZE JavaScript Framework provides modules that let you stray from the bland world of linear animations and into an exotic world of animations driven by arbitrary curve functions, with built-in support for easing curves as well as curves that emulate the complex properties of motion, letting you achieve effects like bounce, springiness, wobble, elasticity, etc. Beyond the built-ins, you have the freedom to roll your own curve functions in order to achieve some of the craziest motion effects you could imagine.

	Check Out Those Curves!
		To get an idea of what curves are all about, why not check out a few examples...

		- [[../examples/curve-explorer.html][*Curve Explorer*]] - Provides a UI for visualizing and experimenting with curve functions, letting you select from a large number of preset curves in its *"PRESETS"* tab, and letting you see the curve expression and modify it to produce new curves.
		- [[../examples/hover-fader-stretching-menu.html][*Hover Fader Stretching Menu*]] - Demonstrates how the =Uize.Widget.HoverFader= widget class can be used to create a stretching menu effect.

	A Simple Curve Example
		Before getting into the juicy details of curves and the powerful concepts surrounding them, consider the following simple example to whet your appetite...

		EXAMPLE
		......................................................................
		Uize.Fx.fadeStyle (
			'myNode',                                 // node
			{left:0,top:0,width:10,height:10},        // start style properties
			{left:100,top:100,width:200,height:200},  // end style properties
			2000,                                     // duration
			{curve:Uize.Curve.easeInOutPow (4)}       // extra fade properties
		);
		......................................................................

		In the above example, the DOM node with the =id= of ='myNode'= is being moved and resized, starting from a position of 0,0 and a size of 10 x 10, and ending up at the position of 100,100 and a size of 200 x 200. Because the =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= static method of the =Uize.Fx= module allows fade properties to be specified in its optional =fadePropertiesOBJ= parameter, a value can be specified for the =curve= state property of the =Uize.Fade= instance that will be used to service the style fade. In this case we're using the =Uize.Curve.easeInOutPow= static method of the =Uize.Curve= module to create a quartic (power of four) ease-in-out curve function. This will produce a transition that starts out slowly, picks up speed, and then slows down to end slowly.

	Important Concepts
		The UIZE JavaScript Framework introduces the following key concepts...

		- `Curve Functions` - functions that generate values for curves.
		- `Curve Function Generators` - functions or methods that generate `curve functions`, possibly accepting parameters that affect the generated curve functions.
		- `Curve Function Modifiers` - function or methods that accept `curve functions` as parameters and that generate modified versions of the source curve functions.

	Curve Functions
		In the UIZE JavaScript Framework, a curve is represented simply as a function that accepts a floating point number in the scale =0= to =1= and returns a value, also in the scale of =0= to =1=, that reflects how that input value is distorted by the curve.

		An Example
			To illustrate the principle of a curve function, let's consider a simple example...

			EXAMPLE
			....................................
			function cubicEaseOut (value) {
				value = 1 - value;
				return 1 - value * value * value;
			}
			....................................

			The above curve function represents a cubic easing out curve, where change in the output value will occur rapidly at the beginning of the curve and then more slowly towards the end, so that there would be easing out of a fade effect that used this curve.

			This curve is actually just a 180 degree rotated version of a cubic easing in curve, which would simply return the input value raised to the power of three. In order to rotate that curve 180 degrees, the curve is flipped both horizontally and vertically. It is flipped horizontally first by complementing the input value (subtracting it from =1=). Then, the value is raised to the power of three. Finally, the cubed value is complemented in order to vertically flip the cubic curve.

			The table of values below compares some sample input values with the output values that our =cubicEaseOut= function would produce...

			...................................
			INPUT VALUE   |   OUTPUT VALUE
			-----------------------------------
			1             |   1
			.9            |   .999
			.8            |   .992
			.7            |   .973
			.6            |   .9359999999999999
			.5            |   .875
			.4            |   .784
			.3            |   .657
			.2            |   .4879999999999999
			.1            |   .2709999999999999
			0             |   0
			...................................

			Looking at this table, what you'll notice first is that the function - while now producing non-linear output values - still produces values in the range of =0= to =1=, where the input value =0= produces the output value =0= and the input value =1= produces the output value =1=. Notably, the difference in output values for the input values of =0= and =.1= is much greater than the difference in output values for the input values of =.9= and =1=. In other words, change is much faster at the beginning of the curve than it is at the end of the curve. This is the "easing out" quality that was mentioned earlier.

		Definition
			A curve function should comply with the following simple requirements...

			Single Argument
				A curve function must accept a single argument, being a floating point number in the scale =0= to =1=.

			Return Value
				A curve function must return a floating point number in the scale =0= to =1=.

			May Produce Overshoot
				A curve function may return a number outside of the range of =0= to =1=.

				Returning values outside of the range of =0= to =1= is useful for producing overshoot or back effects - particularly compelling for curves that emulate motion effects like bounce, springiness, wobble, elasticity, etc.

			Should Handle Overshoot
				A curve function should support input values outside the range of =0= to =1=.

				A curve function should be able to handle input values that were generated from some other curve function that used overshoot to achieve motion effects like bounce, springiness, wobble, elasticity, etc.

			Start At 0, End At 1
				A curve function should start at =0= (ie. the input value =0= should produce the output value =0=) and end at =1= (ie. the input value =1= should produce the output value =1=).

				Curve functions that produce curves that start at the value =0= and end at the value =1= can be rotated 180 degrees to produce new curves that still start at =0= and end at =1=. The rotated version of an `ease-in curve function` would produce an `ease-out curve function`. Similarly, the rotated version of an `ease-out curve function` would produce an `ease-in curve function`.

			Deterministic
				Ideally, a curve function should be deterministic (ie. it should always return the same output value for the same input value), although this is not a hard requirement.

				Curve functions that are computationally complex can be sampled in order to improve performance, so that complex computations aren't performed repeatedly during peformance intensive animation effects. If a curve function is non-deterministic, then it will become deterministic as a result of being sampled. If apparent randomness or noise is desired in a curve, it is better to add it using a deterministic algorithm.

	Using Curve Functions
		Curve functions can be used in a wide variety of applications.

		VISUALIZE IT

		To better visualize how curve functions work and how they affect motion, visit the interactive [[../examples/curve-explorer.html][Curve Explorer]] tool.

		Blending Values
			A curve function can be supplied as a parameter to the =Uize.Fade.blendValues= static method of the =Uize.Fade= class.

			When not specifying a curve to this method, the interpolation used to blend between the two specified values is linear. Specifying your own curve allows you to perform non-linear blending.

			EXAMPLE
			...............................................................
			var
				bouncyCurveFunction = Uize.Curve.Rubber.easeOutBounce (4,2),
				middleOfBounceValue = Uize.Fade.blendValues (
					0,                   // value A
					255,                 // value B
					.5,                  // blend amount (.5 is halfway)
					0,                   // quantization (0 == none)
					bouncyCurveFunction  // curve function
				)
			;
			...............................................................

			After the above code has executed, the =middleOfBounceValue= variable would be left with the value =90.4438142188662=.

		Curve Functions Are Not Blenders
			Curve functions are not blenders, so they can't alone be used to blend between two different values.

			Curve functions simply remap a value in the scale of =0= to =1= to a new value in the scale of =0= to =1=. This reduces the burden on the implementation of curve functions, as they don't all have to deal with the math to blend between values. Additionally, not performing blending in a curve function improves performance when multiple curve functions are combined together to form more complex curve functions, using the curve function modifier methods defined in the =Uize.Curve.Mod= module.

			All this said, it is quite easy to use a curve function to blend between values, as shown in the section `Blending Values`. Furthermore, blender functions can be composed from curve functions by using the convenient =Uize.Curve.makeBlender= static method of the =Uize.Curve= module, as shown in the following example...

			EXAMPLE
			................................................................
			var
				bouncyCurveFunction = Uize.Curve.Rubber.easeOutBounce (4,2),
				bouncyBlender = Uize.Curve.makeBlender (bouncyCurveFunction),
				middleOfBounceValue = bouncyBlender (0,255,.5)
			;
			................................................................

			After the above code has executed, the =middleOfBounceValue= variable would be left with the value =90.4438142188662=. Now, every time that you use the =bouncyBlender= function to blend between two values, it will blend the values using the curve function generated by the statement =Uize.Curve.Rubber.easeOutBounce (4,2)=.

		Controlling Fades
			A curve function can be supplied to an instance of the =Uize.Fade= class by setting the value of its =curve= state property, in order to control the characteristics of the fade's transition.

			When not specifying a curve to a =Uize.Fade= instance, the fade's transition will be linear in nature. In other words, the rate of change will remain constant throughout the fade process. Specifying your own curve allows you to make the fade non-linear in order to emulate motion effects like bounce, springiness, wobble, elasticity, etc.

			EXAMPLE
			.........................................................................
			var positionFade = Uize.Fade ({
				startValue:{left:0,top:0},
				endValue:{left:100,top:100},
				duration:2000,
				quantization:1,
				curve:Uize.Curve.easeInOutPow (4)
			});
			positionFade.wire (
				'Changed.value',
				function () {Uize.Node.setStyle ('myNode',positionFade.get ('value'))}
			);
			positionFade.start ();
			.........................................................................

			Although there are more concise ways of `animating CSS style properties` in order to fade the position of a node, the above example illustrates how a curve function can be specified as a value for the =curve= state property of an instance of the =Uize.Fade= class.

		Controlling Effects
			Because curve functions are supported by the =Uize.Fade= class, any modules that use instances of this class to drive fade effects can also use curve functions and permit curve functions to be used.

			The Uize.Fade.xFactory Module
				The various static methods defined in the =Uize.Fade.xFactory= extension module allow a curve function to be specified in the optional =fadePropertiesOBJ= parameter.

				EXAMPLE
				................................................................................
				Uize.Fade.fade (scrollTo,[0,0],[0,200],800,{curve:Uize.Curve.easeInOutPow (4)});
				................................................................................

			The Uize.Fx Module
				The =Uize.Fx.fadeStyle= static method of the =Uize.Fx= module allows a curve function to be specified in its optional =fadePropertiesOBJ= parameter.

				EXAMPLE
				......................................................................
				Uize.Fx.fadeStyle (
					'myNode',                                 // node
					{left:0,top:0,width:10,height:10},        // start style properties
					{left:100,top:100,width:200,height:200},  // end style properties
					2000,                                     // duration
					{curve:Uize.Curve.easeInOutPow (4)}       // extra fade properties
				);
				......................................................................

			The Uize.Widget.HoverFader Class
				The =Uize.Widget.HoverFader= widget class allows a curve function to be specified in its =fadeIn= and =fadeOut= state properties.

				EXAMPLE
				..................................................................................
				page.addChild (
					'hoverFader',
					Uize.Widget.HoverFader,
					{
						defaultStyle:{width:150,letterSpacing:2,borderRightColor:'0'},
						hoverStyle:{width:240,letterSpacing:9,borderRightColor:'f'},
						fadeIn:{duration:1200,curve:Uize.Curve.Rubber.easeOutElastic (.2)},
						fadeOut:{duration:1000,curve:Uize.Curve.Rubber.easeOutBounce (5,-2,1.5)}
					}
				);
				..................................................................................

			Other Widget Classes
				Some widget classes - such as the =Uize.Widget.ImageWipe= class, and the =Uize.Widget.Swap= class and its subclasses - use an instance of the =Uize.Fade= class to drive their animation.

				Typically this fade instance will be created during construction of an instance of the widget class, and will be publicly accessible via a =fade= instance property. For such classes, a curve function can be set on the fade instance immediately after creation of the widget instance, as shown in the example below...

				EXAMPLE
				..................................................................................
				var myImageWipe = page.addChild ('imageWipe',Uize.Widget.ImageWipe,{built:false});

				myImageWipe.fade.set ({curve:Uize.Curve.easeInOutPow (4)});
				..................................................................................

		Just About Anywhere
			Because curve functions are so elementary, they can really be used anywhere where you'd like to work with scaling values.

	Curve Function Generators
		A curve function generator is a function or method that generates a curve function as its output.

		Examples of curve function generators are the various static methods contained inside the =Uize.Curve= module, the =Uize.Curve.Rubber= module, as well as the various curve function modifier methods contained inside the =Uize.Curve.Mod= module. As stated, the result returned by a curve function generator is a curve function that can be used anywhere that you would use a curve function, such as with instances of the =Uize.Fade= class, or with animation effects initiated by methods of the =Uize.Fx= module.

		Parameterized Curve Function Generators
			Curve function generators can either take no parameters, or they can be parameterized.

			Examples
				Examples of parameterized curve function generators include some of the static methods of the =Uize.Curve= module (such as the various power and circular curve function generators), static methods of the =Uize.Curve.Rubber= module (such as the bounce, back, and elastic curve function generators), as well as the curve function modifier static methods of the =Uize.Curve.Mod= module.

				EXAMPLE
				....................................................................
				var
					superBouncyEaseOut = Uize.Curve.Rubber.easeOutBounce (9,4,1.25),
					muffledBounceEaseOut = Uize.Curve.Rubber.easeOutBounce (3,-4,1.7)
				;
				....................................................................

				After the above code has executed, the values of =superBouncyEaseOut= and =muffledBounceEaseOut= are two different curve functions, each one observing the parameters specified when creating it by calling the =Uize.Curve.Rubber.easeOutBounce= static method.

			No Muss, No Fuss
				Because parameterized curve function generators simply return curve functions, the burden is taken off of other code for passing values for the parameters that only shape a curve - a curve's shape can be defined once when creating its curve function.

				In this way, all that the user of the resulting curve function has to do is supply a value in the scale =0= to =1= to it, and the curve function returns the corresponding value at that point on the curve.

			Memoization
				As an optimization, curve function generators can return a reference to the same underlying curve function each time they are called with identical parameter values.

				However, a parameterized curve function generator must always return a curve function that is unique to its parameter values.

				EXAMPLE
				................................................................
				Uize.Curve.easeOutPow () == Uize.Curve.easeOutPow ()    // true
				Uize.Curve.easeOutPow (3) == Uize.Curve.easeOutPow (3)  // false
				................................................................

				As it's implemented, the statement =Uize.Curve.easeOutPow ()= always returns a reference to the same quadratic ease-out curve function. However, the statement =Uize.Curve.easeOutPow (3)= always returns a new curve function - even for identical values of the =powerFLOAT= parameter.

				As an additional optimization, you could choose to implement [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization][memoization]] for parameterized curve function generators. The parameterized curve function generators in the =Uize.Curve= and =Uize.Curve.Rubber= modules are not memoized, but those that are called without parameters always return a reference to the same shared curve function.

		Easing Equations
			An easing equation is an equation used to produce a special type of curve function - one that produces the effect of easing into, easing out of, easing into and out of, or easing in the middle of a transition.

			Credit Where Credit Is Due
				Thanks go to `Robert Penner` for his work on [[http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/][his easing equations]], which provided a starting point and inspiration for work that has been done in the =Uize.Curve= module and related modules.

				In some cases, his original methods have merely been refactored, such as with the =Uize.Curve.Rubber.easeInElastic= method and related elastic easing curve function generators provided in the =Uize.Curve.Rubber= module. In other cases, the original implementations have been completely replaced, such as with the =Uize.Curve.Rubber.easeInBounce= method and related bounce easing curve function generators provided in the =Uize.Curve.Rubber= module, with the new implementation being much more versatile than the original. Either way, his excellent work has been an inspiration.

			Ease-in Curve Function
				Easing into a transition means that the rate of change will be slow at first and then progressively accelerate. This will produce an effect that starts gently.

			Ease-out Curve Function
				In contrast, easing out of a transition means that the rate of change will slow towards the end, progressively decelerating as the transition approaches the end point. This will produce an effect that ends gently.

				An ease-out curve function is actually just a 180 degree rotated version of an ease-in curve function. In order to rotate the ease-in curve 180 degrees, the curve is flipped both horizontally and vertically. It is flipped horizontally first by complementing the input value (subtracting it from =1=). Then, the value is remapped using the ease-in curve function. Finally, the remapped value is complemented in order to vertically flip the already horizontally flipped curve.

				An ease-out curve function can be generated from a source `ease-in curve function` using the =Uize.Curve.makeEaseOut= static method of the =Uize.Curve= module, as follows...

				............................................................................
				var myEaseOutCurveFunction = Uize.Curve.makeEaseOut (myEaseInCurveFunction);
				............................................................................

			Ease-in-out Curve Function
				Easing into and out of a transition means that the rate of change will be slow at the beginning and end of the transition, and will then be higher inbetween in order to make up. This will produce an effect that starts *and* ends gradually.

				An ease-in-out curve function is the combination of a source `ease-in curve function` occupying the bottom left quadrant, flowing into the 180 degree rotated version of that source `ease-in curve function` occupying the top right quadrant, producing a seamless curve that flows from the bottom left to the top right.

				An ease-in-out curve function can be generated from a source `ease-in curve function` using the =Uize.Curve.makeEaseInOut= static method of the =Uize.Curve= module, as follows...

				................................................................................
				var myEaseInOutCurveFunction = Uize.Curve.makeEaseInOut (myEaseInCurveFunction);
				................................................................................

			Ease-in-the-middle Curve Function
				Easing in the middle means that the rate of change will be fast at the beginning and end of the transition, but will be slower in the middle. This will produce an effect that starts abruptly and ends abruptly, and appears to pause / ease during the middle.

				An ease-in-the-middle curve function is the combination of the 180 degree rotated version of a source `ease-in curve function` occupying the bottom left quadrant, flowing into that source `ease-in curve function` occupying the top right quadrant, producing a seamless curve that flows from the bottom left to the top right.

				An ease-in-the-middle curve function can be generated from a source `ease-in curve function` using the =Uize.Curve.makeEaseMiddle= static method of the =Uize.Curve= module, as follows...

				..................................................................................
				var myEaseMiddleCurveFunction = Uize.Curve.makeEaseMiddle (myEaseInCurveFunction);
				..................................................................................

			Easing Curve Function Generators
				The =Uize.Curve= module provides a number of the more commonly used curve function generators as built-ins.

				This includes curve function generators such as =Uize.Curve.easeInPow=, =Uize.Curve.easeOutPow=, =Uize.Curve.easeInOutPow=, =Uize.Curve.easeInCircular=, =Uize.Curve.easeOutCircular=, etc. Additionally, a number of curve function generators that emulate motion effects like bounce, springiness, wobble, elasticity, etc. are provided in the =Uize.Curve.Rubber= module.

				NAMING CONVENTION

				The naming convention for the easing curve function generators is that the ease-in curve function generators start with the prefix "easeIn", the ease-out curve function generators start with the prefix "easeOut", the ease-in-out curve function generators start with the prefix "easeInOut", and the ease-in-the-middle curve function generators start with the prefix "easeMiddle".

			Making Easing Curve Function Generators
				Static methods for generating easing curve functions can be manufactured by calling the =Uize.Curve.makeEasingCurveGenerators= static method of the =Uize.Curve= module and providing a curve generator function for the `ease-in curve function` version.

				EXAMPLE
				..............................................................
				Uize.Curve.makeEasingCurveGenerators (
					'Power',
					function (power) {
						if (power == null) power = 2;
						return function (value) {return Math.pow (value,power)};
					}
				);
				..............................................................

				The above example would create the four curve generator static methods =Uize.Curve.easeInPower=, =Uize.Curve.easeOutPower=, =Uize.Curve.easeInOutPower=, and =Uize.Curve.easeMiddlePower=. For a more detailed discussion, consult the reference for the =Uize.Curve.makeEasingCurveGenerators= method.

	Curve Function Modifiers
		Curve function modifiers are `curve function generators` that accept `curve functions` as their primary inputs.

		The =Uize.Curve.makeEaseOut=, =Uize.Curve.makeEaseInOut=, and =Uize.Curve.makeEaseMiddle= static methods of the =Uize.Curve= module can be considered curve function modifiers, because they take a curve function as an input and return a modified curve function as an output. Additionally, a good selection of more exotic curve function modifiers are provided in the =Uize.Curve.Mod= module.

		Curve function modifiers operate on the curve functions they are provided in order to produce new, modified curve functions. You can consider them as operators that operate on curve functions to produce new curve functions. They could also be thought of as specialized parameterized curve function generators, where some - or all - of the parameters just happen to be curve functions. As an example, the =Uize.Curve.Mod.blend= static method blends the two specified curve functions to produce a new curve function, with blend parameters that let you specify the blend between the two curve functions.

		"What does it mean to blend two functions?" you may ask. No, JavaScript doesn't support some crazy new math that allows you to add or multiply functions. Blending two curve functions is carried out by returning a new curve function that takes an input value, uses each of the two curve functions that are to be blended and obtains a remapped value from each, then blends between those two values to produce a new output value. This has the effect of blending the curves that would be produced by the two curve functions that are being blended - across their entire input value range. So, effectively, you are blending two curve functions to produce a new curve function.

		EXAMPLE
		..............................................
		// quickly to middle, hesitate, quickly to end

		Uize.Curve.Mod.blend (
			Uize.Curve.easeInSweetPow (1/6),
			Uize.Curve.easeOutSweetPow (1/12),
			Uize.Curve.line (0,1)
		)
		..............................................

		In the above example, the curve function generated by the statement =Uize.Curve.easeInSweetPow (1/6)= is being blended with the curve function generated by the statement =Uize.Curve.easeOutSweetPow (1/12)=, with the blend biased towards the first curve function at the lower input values, and biased towards the second curve function at the higher input values.
