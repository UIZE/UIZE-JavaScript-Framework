This TO DO document is intended to capture all the requirements that need to be satisfied in order to make UIZE a widely acceptable framework that can be integrated into external sites as easily and cleanly as possible.

In order for using UIZE to be a viable option for external sites, the following needs will have to be addressed in UIZE...

Ability to Load Modules from Multiple Sources
	External sites would want to keep their codebase separate from the UIZE codebase, so it would be necessary to provide a way for all modules - JS, CSS, images, HTML templates, etc. - to be able to be organized into separate external site and UIZE areas.

	The dynamic loader system would need to support multiple sources, as well as the build processes.

Packaging
	- JS Packaging
	- CSS Packaging
	- Image Spritifying
	- HTML Template Compiling

Third Party JavaScript
	.

MVC System
	Base classes would need to be provided for the model, view, and controller aspects of an MVC code architecture.

jQuery Interoperability
	A way would have to be provided to allow jQuery code to be used in conjunction with UIZE, which includes jQuery plugins.

	jQuery Files as UIZE Modules
		To satisfy the dependency management system, a way should be provided to allow jQuery files to be wrapped / expressed as UIZE modules.

		This could potentially be achieved by a build handler for 3rd party files that does the wrapping as part of a build process.

Folder Organization of Code
	Currently, UIZE is built around the assumption that all code exists in a flat js folder structure.

	Ideally, in order to facilitate better management of code, UIZE would be adapted to support different code being able to exist in different folders.

Visual Unit Tests for Widgets
	UIZE should provide a way that JavaScript visual widget unit tests can be developed, with a system for easily navigating and running those unit tests.

	This system should also make it possible to provide fake data services setup, as needed, in order to view widgets divorced from live application dependencies.
