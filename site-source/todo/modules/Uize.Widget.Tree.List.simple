This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Widget.Tree.List= module.

- research implementing markup using true nested UL/LI
- refactor to make all styling done through CSS (ie. no img URLs known to JS). Do away with old school approach.
- support for divider items
- move to using UL/LI for markup
- feature to automatically add title property to headings so a tooltip displays the full "path"
