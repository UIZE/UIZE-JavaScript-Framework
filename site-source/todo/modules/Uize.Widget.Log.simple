This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Widget.Log= module.

Features
	- ability to have a display template for each log item
		- can be string or function
			- string, to be used with substitution
			- function (which can be a compiled template)
		- timestamp format ability
		- ability to have different display templates for different types of items
	- ability to display new items at top or bottom
	- ability to filter display of log items (by type or other properties)
	- ability to disable logging
	- automatic timestamping of log items
	- display of line numbers in log
	- color coding?

NOTES
- big question: should a log really just be a dynamic collection, where each log message is a collection item?
	- lots of benefits would accrue by building advanced logging around the collection architecture
