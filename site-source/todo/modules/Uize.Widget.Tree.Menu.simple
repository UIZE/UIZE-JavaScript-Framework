This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Widget.Tree.Menu= module.

- build submenus dynamically -- only when needed (for load performance optimization)
- move to using UL/LI for markup
- make highlight of active menu items "sticky" (ie. not based on a:hover pseudoclass), so that entire choice path can be indicated
- support for heading items
