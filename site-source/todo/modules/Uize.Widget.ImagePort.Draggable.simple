This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Widget.ImagePort.Draggable= module.

ISSUES
- with ctrl-click for zooming, respect click position as indicator of point of interest and stay aligned to that region/point while zooming in or out.
- find a more elegant way to expose portVsScaledDelta info from Uize.Widget.ImagePort

IDEAS
- a mode where the overflow is revealed during drag, with a mask that highlights the port and shades out the overflow
