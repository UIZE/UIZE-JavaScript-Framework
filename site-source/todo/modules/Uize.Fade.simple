This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Fade= module.

- instead of start / stop methods, just use property interface (ie. inProgress property)
- for compound curves and quantization, a way to specify a default for all properties of an object, when an object is specified in order to specify curves or quantization for some properties
	eg.
		................................................................................
		quantization:{
			'*':1,
			opacity:0
		}
		................................................................................

		Without this ability, if you wanted quantization to be 0 for opacity, but 1 for all other properties, you'd be forced to explicitly specify it for all those other properties. The alternative would be to specify quantization:1, but then you can't have 0 for opacity.

- ability to pause and resume a time-based fade
- ability to specify the number of updates in the fade
	1 = gets to end immediately
	2 = start value, then end value
	n = start value, update 2, update 3, ..., end value

- consider changing the implementation of reverse, to instead swap the start and end values (or offer an additional property for this kind of fade reversing)
