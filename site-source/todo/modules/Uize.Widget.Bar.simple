This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Widget.Bar= module.

- eliminate need for setting orientation property (possibly keep, but have 'auto' value as default)
- OPTIMIZE UPDATE PERFORMANCE
	- consider moving some of the wireUi optimization that's currently in Uize.Widget.Bar.Slider into the wireUi method of this class

- truncation for display of value, so doesn't overflow outside of display node
- valid values list
