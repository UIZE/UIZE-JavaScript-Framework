This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Widget.ColorInfo= module.

A simple widget that provides a swatch for previewing a color and shows the current color as a background with white and black text, and as a text color over white and black background.

NOTES
- can be used in Color Sort by RGB Proximity example (both for tooltip as well as large preview of desired color)
- can be used for tooltip in color palette widget
- should combine default HTML template, since it's such a simple widget to begin with
