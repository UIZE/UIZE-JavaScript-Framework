- a simple Web browser widget that lets the user browse the Web in an IFRAME
- back and forward buttons
- a location field for entering a URL
	- location field value is used to set src of iframe on the user hitting enter
	- location field value is blanked out upon use, since it is not possible to keep it current (can't watch iframe's location.href for cross-domain URLs)
- go button next to location field provides another way to commit entered URL
