This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Build.AutoScruncher= module.

TO DO
- should no longer support .library.js files that don't have a Library Contents comment, because it's not really a JS file if it has a bunch of modules listed in the open
- provide a switch to use the source files (ie. scrunched files are replaced with source files)
- provide a switch to enable echo of progress / status
- look into drag-and-drop support, so that the auto-scruncher can exist anywhere, and operate on files or folders
- store a mapping of modified date for all scrunchable JS modules, and then library builder code can use that mapping to determine if a previously built library file should be updated
