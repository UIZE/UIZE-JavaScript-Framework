This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Widget.Button= module.

- fix the bug that Ben had seen with the class names not being updated correctly in his example with radio button widgets
- performance optimization idea: only wire up additional events (click, mousedown, mouseup, mouseout) on mouseover
- double-click actions for buttons
- state->node map to allow different naming schemes? (grayed vs. dimmed, etc.)
- state->className map to allow different naming schemes
- state cumulative mode (exclusive or cumulative)
