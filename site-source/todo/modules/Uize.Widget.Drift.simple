This is a proposal document for a =Uize.Widget.Drift= module.

Wires up a node that is being cropped by a containing node so that it automatically drifts inside its containing node in order to reveal over time all of its contents.

Motion may involve some arbitrary angle and bouncing at edges, with slight randomization of reflection angle on bouncing to avoid too repetitive of an animation path.
