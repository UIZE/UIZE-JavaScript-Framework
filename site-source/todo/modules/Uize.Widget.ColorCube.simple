This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Widget.ColorCube= module.

IMPROVEMENTS
- allow setting class name for swatch nodes
- pair with other class to wire up swatches to fire event (for actual selection)

IDEAS
- double-clicking or ctrl-clicking a swatch could set all four corner colors to that color (only useful for color cubes where UI, such as sliders or input boxes, provides control over the corner colors)
- ability, with a draggable target overlay icon, to select colors continuously based on pixel coordinates within cube
