This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Comm= module.

- must support synchronous communication
	- one thing that Ben would like to do is implement a Uize.Comm.Wsh
- provide a way to allow JavaScript functions to be registered as handlers for specific requests, intercepting requests before they reach the performRequest method of a subclass. This would be useful for emulation of AJAX communication in tests and demos.
- caching
	- edge case optimization: consolidate consecutive requests when identical and memory caching is in use
- flushCache property of request object
- timeout failure mechanism
- cancelability for requests
- configurable comm_mode & output format query params (ie. not always assumed)
