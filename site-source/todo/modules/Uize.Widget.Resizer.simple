This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Widget.Resizer= module.

- BUG: issue with minWidth and minHeight, where min for an axis is not observed when resizing from opposite axis
- SUBCLASSING
	- deal with where jiggler should go
	- make sure all Uize.Widget.Resizer.Marquee references to Uize.Widget.Resizer superclass are through public interface

- create mechanism by which node map can be overrided for the various nodes that a resizable palette or other subclass might need to override
- automatically pick up coordinates each time drag is initiated, so that if the area is moved / resized through other means, it takes effect

- support for floating point coordinates
- support for resize pinned to center using ctrl modifier key
- support for constraining to not fall entirely outside of a specified region (ie. hanging-on-by-a-thread mode)
- support snapping behaviors, with modifier key for override
- support for maximum dimensions (maxWidth, maxHeight)
- support for allowing override of constrained aspect ratio (using modifier key?) -- is this the same as "concept of preferred aspect ratio" that I made a note about at one point?
- perhaps storing of start drag positions to be used by end-of-drag handlers or in-drag-rest handlers

- deal with issue of swapping over sides in preserve aspect ratio mode

- fire events all through drag (whenever positioning changes)
- highlight current handle being dragged
