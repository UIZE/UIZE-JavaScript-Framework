This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Json= module.

- document Uize.Json.encodingOptionsPresets static property
- perhaps optimize the mini option for higher performance, possibly avoiding recursion?
- rely on new JSON object that's supported in FF3.5 and IE8 for mini mode
- a safe mode that will neutralize </script> and other HTML tags inside string literals by escaping the less than sign as \x3c
- for strict mode, must exclude object properties whose values are undefined, null, function, non-simple object, and possibly more prohibited value types (refer to JSON spec online) - probably easier just to include only sanctioned value types (primitives, and simple objects and arrays)
