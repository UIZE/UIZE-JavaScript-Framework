This is a TO DO document for the =Uize.Widget.Form= module.

Basically, a generic container for numerous input widgets, and something that manages the full data set.

FEATURES / BENEFITS

- makes it easy to build input UI for an arbitrary data set (will be invaluable for examples pages)
- allows specifying default widget types for certain input types (but is set to generic defaults)
- uses a Uize.Widget.Committer instance
- integrates validation
- can bind widgets to hidden form fields
