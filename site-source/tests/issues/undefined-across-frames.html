<script type="text/javascript">

var _undefined;
function functionInHostDocument (_paramThatShouldBeUndefined) {
	alert ('Undefined values across frames match exactly...\n\n' + (_paramThatShouldBeUndefined === _undefined));
}

</script>

<p>This test demonstrates that undefined values from different frames match exactly in a strict equality operator. So, there is no window context specific difference in the undefined values.</p>

<p>In the test, a variable exists in a host document that has an undefined value. In an iframe, another variable exists that has an undefined value. When a link in the iframe is clicked, the value of the variable from the iframe is passed as a parameter value in a call to a function that exists in the host document. In this function, the passed parameter is compared in a strict equality expression with the host document's undefined variable</p>

<p>What this test establishes is that it is always safe to use a strict comparison against a variable that is known to be undefined (instead of using the typeof operator) in order to determine if values are undefined, even if those values originate from a different frame. This is an important thing to establish, because there is an issue with the <b>instanceof</b> operator where using the operator fails to produce the expected result if an instance of an object is passed from a different frame or window.</p>
