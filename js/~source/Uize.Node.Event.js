							...................................................

							Not a Character Code
								It's important to point out that the key code for a keyboard event does not correspond in a predictable or meaningful way to a character that might be produced when a key is pressed in a focused text input field.

								For example, the key code when "Shift-a" is pressed is the same as when just "a" is pressed, even though the former would produce a capital "A" while the latter would produce a lowercase "a". The key code =65=, in this case, merely identifies the "A" key on the keyboard. In other cases, certain keys will produce key codes that don't meaningfully map to characters in the ASCII character set. For example, the key code for the down arrow key is =40=, and =40= is the ASCII character code for the "(" (open parenthesis) character - not a meaningful mapping at all.

							Testing for Certain Keys
								As a convenience, a number of static methods are provided in this module to make it easier to detect certain keys without having to remember the key codes.

								An example is the =Uize.Node.Event.isKeyEnter= method, which tests if the key being pressed down or released is the enter key. Other such methods include: =Uize.Node.Event.isKeyEscape=, =Uize.Node.Event.isKeyDownArrow=, =Uize.Node.Event.isKeyInsert=, =Uize.Node.Event.isKeyTab=, etc.

						Uize.Node.Event.stopPropagation
							Stops the propagation of the specified DOM event to other nodes in the DOM.

							SYNTAX
							..............................................
							Uize.Node.Event.stopPropagation (domEventOBJ);
							..............................................

							Using this method for an event will prevent the event from being propagated / bubbled up to nodes that are up the parentNode chain for the node that is the target of the event. Consider the following example...

							EXAMPLE
							..........................................................
							Uize.Node.wire (
								myNode,
								'click',
								function (domEvent) {
									Uize.Node.Event.stopPropagation (domEvent);
									alert ('You should see this message.');
								}
							);
							Uize.Node.wire (
								myNode.parentNode,
								'click',
								function (domEvent) {
									if (Uize.Node.Event.target (domEvent) == myNode) {
										alert ('You should NOT be seeing this message!');
									}
								}
							);
							..........................................................

							In the above example, handlers are being wired for the =click= event of the node =myNode= and its parent node. Under normal circumstances, the user clicking on =myNode= would cause the =click= event to be fired first for that node and then for its parent node as the event is bubbled. In this case, however, the handler for =click= on =myNode= is using the =Uize.Node.Event.stopPropagation= method to cancel the bubbling of the event up to the parent node. Therefore, clicking on the node =myNode= should never produce an alert with the message "You should NOT be seeing this message!".

							This method abstracts the difference between Microsoft Internet Explorer, which supports the proprietary =cancelBubble= property on the event object, and other browsers that support the DOM standard =stopPropagation= method of the event object.
