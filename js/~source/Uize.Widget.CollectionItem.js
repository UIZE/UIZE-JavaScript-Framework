	Introduction
		The =Uize.Widget.CollectionItem= widget class manages state for an item that is intended to be one of many items owned by a collection widget instance.

		*DEVELOPERS:* `Chris van Rensburg`, `Jan Borgersen`

		In a Nutshell
			The =Uize.Widget.CollectionItem= class implements and manages the user interface for an item in a collection and is intended to be used in conjunction with the =Uize.Widget.Collection= class (or subclass).

			Some examples of collection items would be...

			- search results in a search results grid
			- movies in a queue of pending movie rentals
			- books in a list of book recommendations, in order of ratings score

											NOTES
											- the markup for this child widget is optional, and a given implementation of this widget in HTML does not need to offer a =remove= button
											- see the related =Remove= instance event

									Instance Events
										Remove
											An instance event that is fired when the user clicks on the =remove= button of an instance.

											The =Uize.Widget.CollectionItem= class (or subclass) is not responsible for removing the item represented by an instance. Instead, the =Remove= event is fired and handled by an instance of the =Uize.Widget.Collection= class (or subclass) that owns the collection items as child widgets. The =Uize.Widget.Collection= class then performs the operations necessary to update the data set for the collection of items. Also, the =Uize.Widget.Collection= class is responsible for deciding if just the item whose =remove= button was clicked should be removed, or if all currently selected items should be removed.

											NOTES
											- see the related =remove= child widget
