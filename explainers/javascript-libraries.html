	<div class="contents1">
		<p>The UIZE JavaScript Framework provides a system for bundling many modules into single library files to reduce network traffic and improve performance.</p>
		
		<p>In the UIZE JavaScript Framework, JavaScript libraries are bundles of <a href="javascript-modules.html">JavaScript Modules</a>. Think of a JavaScript module as like a book, where the various methods and properties of the module make up the "pages" of the book. A library is a collection of books. So, in this metaphor, a JavaScript library file is a collection of JavaScript modules, bundled together into a single file. JavaScript libraries offer a performance benefit for pages, by reducing the number of HTTP requests needed in order for the page to have all the JavaScript modules it needs - especially important for pages with rich client interactivity that may use dozens of different modules.</p>

	<div class="contents1">
		<p>JavaScript library files - both the source versions and built versions - are named with a <code>.library.js</code> file extension and can live anywhere in the folder structure of your Web site project.</p>
		
		<p>While these JavaScript library files can live anywhere, they can only reference JavaScript modules that live inside the JavaScript modules folder. Also, while they can live anywhere, the source versions of JavaScript library files very often live inside the source folder for JavaScript modules. The built versions of JavaScript library files are saved to a location according to the configuration of the Build Environment Variables (see the <a href="javascript-build-scripts.html">JavaScript Build Scripts</a> explainer for more information).</p>

			<div class="contents3">
				<p>The JavaScript modules to be included in a built library file are specified in the source version of the library file using a special comment syntax.</p>
				
				<p>The comment that lists the modules to be included in a built library file should start with <code>/* Library Contents</code> (it's case and space insensitive, so <code>/*LIBRARYCONTENTS</code> should work too), and the names of the various modules to include should be listed inside that comment, each on a new line (indentation will be ignored). There should be only one Library Contents comment per library file - the first one is observed and any others will be ignored.</p>

					<p>Any individual line inside the Library Contents comment can be commented out by making the first non-whitespace character of the line not a valid identifier starting character. In JavaScript, valid identifier names can be started with any of the lowercase letters "a" through "z", the uppercase letters "A" through "Z", and the characters "$" (dollar) and "_" (underscore). Any line of the Library Contents comment that doesn't start with one of these characters is simply ignored. The following example shows a bunch of lines that are commented out using different prefix characters...</p>

					<p>While the above example illustrates that a variety of different commenting techniques can be used to comment out lines in the Library Contents comment, a common convention is to use the standard JavaScript single line comment prefix "//". Comments can be used inside the Library Contents comment to provide headings for sections of the modules list, and also to comment out modules from the list. Indentation can also be used along with comments to make the contents of the Library Contents comment more readable, by indenting modules under heading comments for different sections of the list. Consider the following example...</p>

					<p>In the above <a href="#3_1_1">Library Contents</a> comment, two lines commented using a "//" prefix are serving as headings for sections of the list, and two modules in the second section are commented out using a "//" prefix.

			<div class="contents3">
				<p>The example shown above includes a module declaration that declares the library as a module.</p>
				
				<p>This is optional, but has the benefit of allowing a library file to be loaded in through an entry in the <code>required</code> list of some other module declaration (see <a href="#4_3">Requiring a JavaScript Library Module</a> for more details).</p>

				<div class="contents4">
					<p>A library module can be named anything, but you must ensure that the namespace in which the library module is defined exists at the time that its module declaration is encountered.</p>
					
					<p>For example, if you choose to name your library module <code>MyNamespace.MyLibraryName.library</code>, then the namespace <code>MyNamespace.MyLibraryName</code> will have to exist before the module declaration for <code>MyNamespace.MyLibraryName.library</code> is encountered. Now, the namespace <code>MyNamespace.MyLibraryName</code> is not likely to be defined in a file other than the library module, so you would need to include two module declarations in this case in order to avoid the module loader mechanism trying to dynamically load <code>MyNamespace.MyLibraryName</code> before it then defines <code>MyNamespace.MyLibraryName.library</code>. Consider the following example...</p>
					
					<p><span class="allCaps">EXAMPLE</span></p>
					
					
<pre class="sample-code">/* Library Contents

  ... ... ...
*/

Uize.module ({name:'MyNamespace.MyLibraryName'});
Uize.module ({name:'MyNamespace.MyLibraryName.library'});
</pre>
					
					<p>The above example assumes that <code>MyNamespace</code> is already defined, or included in the <a href="#3_1_1">Library Contents</a> list. If this is not guaranteed to be the case, and if you wish to avoid dynamically loading an external file that simply defines this namespace, then you can also define that namespace in your library module, as in...</p>

					<p>When creating a library specifically to bundle all the JavaScript modules needed by a page widget class, a convention that can be used is to use the module name of the page widget class as the namespace for the library module.</p>

Similarly, a library module for the page widget base class could be named <code>Uize.Widget.Page.library</code>, since it would bundle all modules required by the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Widget.Page.html">Uize.Widget.Page</a></code> module.</p>

			<p>Another way to load in a JavaScript library file is to require it as a module.</p>
			
			<p>When a JavaScript library file includes an <a href="#3_1_2">Optional Module Declaration</a> that declares a namespace for the library file, then that library file can be required as a module, and requiring it will result in it being dynamically loaded in by the module loader mechanism - if it is not already loaded. Using this approach, it is not necessary to have a dedicated <code>script</code> tag for sourcing in the library file - the library module can simply be added to the <code>required</code> list of the anonymous module declaration that sets up the page widget instance in the page.</p>

			<p>A benefit of making JavaScript library files actual modules and requiring them is that they will automatically be loaded from the correct location where all other scrunched JavaScript modules are loaded from. This eliminates additional script tags whose <code>src</code> attribute would need to be tweaked when switching back and forth between using source or scrunched code. Of course, if you're using a server code method for writing script tags into your pages and a server config variable for switching back and forth between source and scrunched code, then this is less of an issue.</p>

This means that even when the source version of the library module is loaded in - the version that doesn't include or require any JavaScript modules - your page will still work correctly.
