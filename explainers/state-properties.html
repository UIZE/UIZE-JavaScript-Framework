			<div class="contents3">
				<p>An invaluable feature, when using JavaScript in the context of a Web document, is <b>reflection</b>.</p>
				
				<p>The reflection of an element node's attributes and style properties to the JavaScript scripting language, combined with the ability of a document to modify itself through that language, provides an intuitive and lightweight way to modify the state of the user interface, without understanding the inner working of how state change is managed by the browser's layout / rendering engine.</p>
				
				<p>This is a huge load off the mind of a Web UI engineer, since undoubtedly there are any number of very clever ways in which handling state change is optimized for different scenarios, and undoubtedly there are any number of specific updater methods that are kicked off in carefully chosen order under different circumstances. The UI engineer doesn't have to care about what the browser has to do in order to synchronize the display to a changed state. The change could be minimal, or it could be very major.</p>

			<div class="contents3">
				<p>The UIZE JavaScript Framework adopts a similar tack, providing a state interface through its state properties mechanism.</p>
				
				<p>In spirit, a widget class should expose its state through the state properties, and should register <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handlers for these properties, as appropriate, in order to synchronize the UI to a changed state. The application developer using the widgets then does not have to worry about a suite of updater methods and understand why two should be used in a specific order in one case, but three should be used in any order in some other case (for example). We call this the <b>"make it so"</b> principle. You tell an instance what state it should be in, and it figures out how to get all its junk into that new state.</p>

			<p>What good is a state property mechanism if it doesn't facilitate something useful?</p>
			
			<p>Conforming a value is one such thing that is facilitated by the state property mechanism of the UIZE JavaScript Framework. When registering state properties it is possible to register a <code>conformer</code> function to enforce valid values. Let's consider an example...</p>
			
			
<pre class="sample-code">var MyClass = Uize.Class.subclass ();
MyClass.registerProperties ({
  _percentLoaded:{
    name:'percentLoaded',
    conformer:function (_value) {return Uize.constrain (_value,0,100)},
    value:0
  }
});
var myClass = new MyClass ({percentLoaded:200});
alert (myClass.get ('percentLoaded'));
</pre>
			
			<p>In the above code, the <code>alert</code> statement will display the text <code>100</code> in the alert dialog.</p>
			
			<p>This example uses the extended form for registering a state property that lets you define the property's "profile" (but we'll get into that in more detail a bit later). In the example, a <code>conformer</code> function is registered for the <code>percentLoaded</code> state property, that conforms the property's value so that it doesn't fall outside of the range of <code>0</code> to <code>100</code>. So, even though the code is trying to set the property's value to <code>200</code> during construction of an instance, the conformer conforms the value to not fall out of bounds.</p>
			
			<p>Custom conformer functions are discussed in more detail in the section <a href="#5_9">Conformer Function</a>.</p>

			<div class="contents3">
				<p>By using an unscrunchable (effectively public) name for a state property's private name, and not specifying the public name so that it defaults to its unscrunchable private name, you end up with a "naked" state property whose value can be accessed outside of the implementation for a class (such as in application code) with a simple dereferencing.</p>
				
				<p><span class="allCaps">EXAMPLE</span></p>

				<p>In the above example, all the state properties have public names that are the same as their unscrunchable private names.

				<p>This technique doesn't offer the code size benefits of scrunching, but in certain <b>exceptional</b> cases it may offer sufficiently compelling performance benefits where it is more desirable to avoid an extra method call in order to access a state property's value.

			<div class="contents3">
				<p>By using a scrunchable name for a state property's private name (this is the typical the case, of course), and by not specifying the public name so that it defaults to its private name, you end up with what is effectively a private state property that can only be used within the class that defines it.</p>

				<p>In the above example, the state properties <code>_prop1</code>, <code>_prop2</code>, and <code>_prop3</code> are all private.

Code inside the class can, however, access the properties (eg. <code>this.set ({_prop1:'value'})</code> or <code>this._prop1</code>). The benefit of a private state property is that you can employ the mechanisms that come with state properties, such as <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handlers and <code>conformer</code> functions.</p>
				
				<p><span class="allCaps">IMPORTANT</span></p>
				
				<p>In contrast to <code>_prop1</code>, <code>_prop2</code>, and <code>_prop3</code>, <code>_prop4</code> and <code>_prop5</code> are not correctly registered as private state properties because the public name is specified in a string literal, which is not scrunched.

			<p>Through a facility of the <code>name</code> property in the profile of a state property, multiple alternate public names can be specified for a state property.</p>

			<p>In the above example, a state property is being registered for the class <code>MyClass</code>, with the two public names <code>title</code> and <code>displayTitle</code>. When creating an instance of <code>MyClass</code>, a call to set the value for <code>displayTitle</code> is equivalent to setting the value for <code>title</code>, since both public names map to the same underlying state property. So, in the above code, the <code>alert</code> statement will display the text <code>HELLO</code> in the alert dialog.</p>

				<p>An <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler registered for a state property is executed <b>every time</b> that the property's value changes - even when the property is initialized to an initial value during construction of an instance.</p>
				
				<p>During construction of an instance of a class, the value of each registered state property starts out as <code>undefined</code>. If an initial value is specified for the property (using the <code>value</code> property of the profile), then the value is set during construction, and a change in value from <code>undefined</code> to the specified initial value will trigger any <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler registered for the property.</p>

				<p>In the above example, the <code>area</code> state property is registered. An <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler registered for each of the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> state properties updates the value of <code>area</code> to be the product of <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. Now, even though there is no call to the <code>set</code> method to set values for <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, the value of <code>area</code> is correct immediately after construction of the <code>myClass</code> instance. This is because the <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler for <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> is executed the first time their values change from <code>undefined</code> to their registered initial value of <code>10</code>.</p>
				
				<p>This behavior can be both a good thing and a bad thing. Without a question, it's something that needs to be kept in mind when writing <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler code. In the previous example, it was actually a convenient behavior. However, in some cases it may be necessary to conditionalize some code inside an <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler in order to make sure it's not executed too early on in the setup of an instance, such as when not every aspect of the instance is fully set up and ready/safe for the <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> code to be executed.</p>
				
				<p><span class="allCaps">EXAMPLE 2</span></p>
				
				
<pre class="sample-code">MyClass.registerProperties ({

				<p>In the above example, an <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler function is registered that is executed each time the value of <code>percentLoaded</code> changes, and this function's implementation displays the current value in a node in the document (we're assuming this code is transplanted from a widget class' implementation).</p>
				
				<p>In this particular case, we don't want to touch the DOM during construction of the instance and before the widget has been wired up, since this would drastically limit the flexibility of the widget class and how application code using the class could control setup of the application logic. So, in the <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler's implementation the code is conditionalized to check on the wired state of the instance. If the instance isn't wired yet, the DOM is not touched. Other cases like this may arise, where only certain aspects of handling a change in value of a state property should be enabled during construction.</p>

				<p>Similarly, if a <code>conformer</code> function is defined for the state property, then multiple attemps to set different values could still result in the value changing only once, if, for example, the registered conformer function has the effect of constraining the value of the property to a range.</p>

			<p>When using the <a href="#5_3">The Complete Profile</a> form to register a state property, a <code>conformer</code> function can be registered to ensure that the value for the property is always conformed to be a valid value.</p>
			
			<p>Normally, whatever value is specified for a state property when calling the <code>set</code> method is the new value that gets set for that property. However, specifying the optional conformer allows you to register a function that should be executed before the state property's value actually changes, providing an opportunity to constrain or correct the value, or to abort the set so that the property's value remains unchanged.</p>
			
			<p><span class="allCaps">EXAMPLE</span></p>

			<p>In the above code, the <code>alert</code> statement will display the text <code>100</code> in the alert dialog.</p>
			
			<p>In the example, a <code>conformer</code> function is registered for the <code>percentLoaded</code> state property, that conforms the property's value so that it doesn't fall outside of the range of <code>0</code> to <code>100</code>.

			<p><span class="allCaps">IN A NUTSHELL</span></p>
			
			<p>When you register a <code>conformer</code> function for a state property, that function gets executed each time there is an attempt to set a value for that property. Your conformer function should expect to receive one parameter, being the new value that is being attempted to be set. Your conformer function should do what it needs to in order to conform the new value, and then return the conformed value as its result. The conformer function is called as a method on the instance to which the state property belongs, so it can access other state and methods for the instance using the <code>this</code> keyword, including the current value for the property being set.</p>

				<p>Your conformer function is executed before the value of the state property is changed.</p>
				
				<p>If the conformer function results in the value not changing, then any <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler function that you registered for the property will not get executed.</p>

myClass.set ({percentLoaded:200});  // does nothing (because value doesn't change)
myClass.set ({percentLoaded:200});  // does nothing (because value doesn't change)

				<p>Like the previous example, the <code>percentLoaded</code> state property has a conformer function registered that ensures that its value does not fall outside of the range of <code>0</code> to <code>100</code>. Additionally, an <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler function is registered that alerts the property's new value, each time it changes.</p>
				
				<p>Now, there are three calls to set the value of <code>percentLoaded</code> to <code>200</code>. Because the initial value of the property (as specified in the <code>value</code> property of the profile) is <code>0</code>, the first set will result in the value <code>200</code> being constrained to <code>100</code>, the <code>percentLoaded</code> state property will be set to this value, and the <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler will produce an alert dialog with the text <code>100</code>. However, the subsequent two calls to the <code>set</code> method will not cause the <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler to be executed, because on each occasion the value <code>200</code> will be conformed to <code>100</code>, there will be an attempt to set the property's value to <code>100</code>, and there will be no change in its value because its value was already conformed to <code>100</code> by the first set.</p>

				<p>A <code>conformer</code> function can be used to validate a new value and effectively abort the set if a new value fails validation. In such cases, a failed validation will result in the state property remaining unchanged.</p>
				
				<p>The way this is accomplished is for the conformer function to return the current value for the state property in the event that the new value fails validation. Because the conformer function registered for a state property is called as a method on the instance to which the property belongs, the conformer can access other state and methods for the instance using the <code>this</code> keyword, including the current value for the property being set.</p>

          ? _value
          : this._emailAddress
      );
    },
    value:''
  }
});
</pre>
				
				<p>In the above example, the <code>emailAddress</code> state property is being registered. The value of this property should be a well formed e-mail address. It may also be empty / unset, which is its initial value as specified in the <code>value</code> property of its profile. The conformer function first tests that a new value being set is a string. Then, it tests that the string is either empty or, if not, it uses a regular expression to determine if the non-empty value is a correctly formatted e-mail address.</p>
				
				<p>If the validation succeeds, the conformer returns the new value as its result. If validation fails, then the conformer returns the current value. Returning the current value results in the state property's value not changing, so this is effectively a way to abort a set.</p>

			<p>Now, the handler for this event alerts the current value for the property. So, the first four of the <code>set</code> statements in the example will result in the value of <code>percentLoaded</code> changing, which will fire the <code>Changed.percentLoaded</code> virtual event, whose handler will display the current value in an alert dialog. Important to note is that the last <code>set</code> statement will not cause the value of <code>percentLoaded</code> to change. That's because the <code>conformer</code> function constrains its value to the range of <code>0</code> to <code>100</code>, and the previous attempt to set its value to <code>200</code> caused it to be constrained to the maximum in its range. Once constrained to <code>100</code>, attempting to set its value to <code>300</code> wouldn't budge it any higher from <code>100</code>.

			<p>In the above example, the <code>percentLoaded</code> state property is being registered. Even though this property might represent the primary value for instances of the class, it is desirable for the property's name to be <code>percentLoaded</code> (rather than the more generic <code>value</code>) for general usability/understandability of the class' interface. However, it would be nice to still be able to get the benefit of the <code>valueOf Intrinsic Method</code>. Not a problem. This is accomplished by naming the state property both <code>percentLoaded</code> <b>AND</b> <code>value</code>. Notice how the three last statements in the example all produce the same output.</p>

			<p>Cases can arise where it is desirable to register a state property whose value is derived from the values of one or more other state properties, and that acts as a kind of state summary for the instance.</p>
			
			<p><span class="allCaps">EXAMPLE</span></p>
			
			
<pre class="sample-code">var MyClass = Uize.Class.subclass ();
function _updateArea () {
  this.set ({area:this._width * this._height});
}
MyClass.registerProperties ({
  _area:'area',
  _height:{
    name:'height',
    value:10,
    onChange:_updateArea
  },
  _width:{
    name:'width',
    value:10,
    onChange:_updateArea
  }
});
myClass = new MyClass;
alert (myClass.get ('area'));         // will alert the value 100

myClass.set ({width:5});
alert (myClass.get ('area'));         // will alert the value 50

myClass.set ({height:5});
alert (myClass.get ('area'));         // will alert the value 25

myClass.set ({width:20,height:20});
alert (myClass.get ('area'));         // will alert the value 400
</pre>
			
			<p>In the above example, the <code>area</code> state property is being registered. This property is not intended to be set by an application, since its value is derived in the class' implementation from the values of two other state properties registered for the class: <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. An <code><a href="#5_8">onChange</a></code> handler function is registered in the profile for each of the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> state properties. If the value of either (or both) of these properties changes, then the <code>_updateArea</code> function is called as a method on the instance, and this function sets a new value for the <code>area</code> state property that is the product of the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> values.</p>

		<div class="contents2">
			<p>There is no formal mechanism within the UIZE JavaScript Framework for declaring a state property as being read-only.</p>
			
			<p>There might be occasions when it's desirable to expose some instance state through a state property - with all the benefits that come from using state properties - without it being intended for application code to ever set the property's value. But the <code><a href="../reference/Uize.Class.html">Uize.Class</a></code> base class cannot distinguish between a state property's value being set from within the class' implementation, or from some application code using an instance of the class.</p>
			
			<p>In the event that a state property is intended only to reflect state that is maintained within a class' implementation, the property should just be documented as intended for read-only use in the documentation for the class. Incorrect setting of the property could cause code to fail, but in the rather open JavaScript language any number of other, more damaging things could be done by application code to trip up a class' implementation.</p>
			
			<p>In short, read-only state properties are more of a convention / design pattern than anything else. The many classes of the UIZE JavaScript Framework are certainly replete with examples of weakly "enforced" read-only properties.</p>
